<p class="drop-cap">MATILDA’S ears were red and shiny.
So were her cheeks. Her hands were
red too. This was because Pridmore had
washed her. It was not the usual washing,
which makes you clean and comfortable, but
the “thorough good wash,” which makes you
burn and smart till you wish you could be like
the poor little savages who do not know anything,
and run about bare in the sun, and only
go into the water when they are hot.</p>

<p>Matilda wished she could have been born in
a savage tribe instead of at Brixton.</p>

<p>“Little savages,” she said, “don’t have
their ears washed thoroughly, and they don’t
have new dresses that are prickly in the insides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
round their arms, and cut them round the
neck. Do they, Pridmore?”</p>

<p>But Pridmore only said, “Stuff and nonsense,”
and then she said, “don’t wriggle so,
child, for goodness’ sake.”</p>

<p>Pridmore was Matilda’s nursemaid. Matilda
sometimes found her trying. Matilda was
quite right in believing that savage children
do not wear frocks that hurt. It is also true
that savage children are not over-washed,
over-brushed, over-combed, gloved, booted,
and hatted and taken in an omnibus to
Streatham to see their Great-aunt Willoughby.
This was intended to be Matilda’s fate. Her
mother had arranged it. Pridmore had prepared
her for it. Matilda, knowing resistance
to be vain, had submitted to it.</p>

<p>But Destiny had not been consulted, and
Destiny had plans of its own for Matilda.</p>

<p>When the last button of Matilda’s boots had
been fastened (the button-hook always had a
nasty temper, especially when it was hurried,
and that day it bit a little piece of Matilda’s
leg quite spitefully) the wretched child was
taken downstairs and put on a chair in the
hall to wait while Pridmore popped her own
things on.</p>

<p>“I shan’t be a minute,” said Pridmore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a><br /><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Matilda knew better. She seated herself to
wait, and swung her legs miserably. She had
been to her Great-aunt Willoughby’s before,
and she knew exactly what to expect. She
would be asked about her lessons, and how
many marks she had, and whether she had
been a good girl. I can’t think why grown-up
people don’t see how impertinent these
questions are. Suppose you were to answer,
“I’m top of my class, Auntie, thank you,
and I’m very good. And now let’s have a
little talk about you. Aunt, dear, how much
money have you got, and have you been
scolding the servants again, or have you tried
to be good and patient as a properly brought
up aunt should be, eh, dear?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/p007.jpg" width="303" height="562" alt="Matilda on fancy chair" />
<div class="caption">MATILDA SWUNG HER LEGS MISERABLY.</div>
</div>

<p>Try this method with one of your aunts
next time she begins asking you questions,
and write and tell me what she says.</p>

<p>Matilda knew exactly what the Aunt
Willoughby’s questions would be, and she
knew how, when they were answered, her aunt
would give her a small biscuit with carraway
seeds in it, and then tell her to go with
Pridmore and have her hands and face washed
again.</p>

<p>Then she would be sent to walk in the
garden—the garden had a gritty path, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
geraniums and calceolarias and lobelias in the
beds. You might not pick anything. There
would be minced veal at dinner, with three-cornered
bits of toast round the dish, and a
tapioca pudding. Then the long afternoon
with a book, a bound volume of the “Potterer’s
Saturday Night”—nasty small print—and
all the stories about children who died
young because they were too good for this
world.</p>

<p>Matilda wriggled wretchedly. If she had
been a little less uncomfortable she would
have cried, but her new frock was too tight
and prickly to let her forget it for a moment,
even in tears.</p>

<p>When Pridmore came down at last, she
said, “Fie, for shame! What a sulky face!”</p>

<p>And Matilda said, “I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you are,” said Pridmore, “you
know you are, you don’t appreciate your
blessings.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was your Aunt Willoughby,”
said Matilda.</p>

<p>“Nasty, spiteful little thing!” said Pridmore,
and she shook Matilda.</p>

<p>Then Matilda tried to slap Pridmore, and
the two went down the steps not at all pleased
with each other. They went down the dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
road to the dull omnibus, and Matilda was
crying a little.</p>

<p>Now Pridmore was a very careful person,
though cross, but even the most careful
persons make mistakes sometimes—and she
must have taken the wrong omnibus, or this
story could never have happened, and where
should we all have been then? This shows
you that even mistakes are sometimes valuable,
so do not be hard on grown-up people if they
are wrong sometimes. You know after all, it
hardly ever happens.</p>

<p>It was a very bright green and gold omnibus,
and inside the cushions were green and very
soft. Matilda and her nursemaid had it all
to themselves, and Matilda began to feel more
comfortable, especially as she had wriggled
till she had burst one of her shoulder-seams
and got more room for herself inside her
frock.</p>

<p>So she said, “I’m sorry I was cross, Priddy
dear.”</p>

<p>Pridmore said, “So you ought to be.” But
she never said <i>she</i> was sorry for being cross.
But you must not expect grown-up people to
say that.</p>

<p>It was certainly the wrong omnibus because
instead of jolting slowly along dusty streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
it went quickly and smoothly down a green
lane, with flowers in the hedges, and green
trees overhead. Matilda was so delighted
that she sat quite still, a very rare thing with
her. Pridmore was reading a penny story
called “The Vengeance of the Lady Constantia,”
so she did not notice anything.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I shan’t tell her,” said
Matilda, “she’d stop the ’bus as likely as
not.”</p>

<p>At last the ’bus stopped of its own accord.
Pridmore put her story in her pocket and
began to get out.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” she said, and got out very
quickly and ran round to where the horses
were. They were white horses with green
harness, and their tails were very long indeed.</p>

<p>“Hi, young man!” said Pridmore to the
omnibus driver, “you’ve brought us to the
wrong place. This isn’t Streatham Common,
this isn’t.”</p>

<p>The driver was the most beautiful omnibus
driver you ever saw, and his clothes were like
him in beauty. He had white silk stockings
and a ruffled silk shirt of white, and his coat
and breeches were green and gold. So was
the three-cornered hat which he lifted very
politely when Pridmore spoke to him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a><br /><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“I fear,” he said kindly, “that you must
have taken, by some unfortunate misunderstanding,
the wrong omnibus.”</p>

<p>“When does the next go back?”</p>

<p>“The omnibus does not go back. It runs
from Brixton here once a month, but it doesn’t
go back.”</p>

<p>“But how does it get to Brixton again, to
start again, I mean,” asked Matilda.</p>

<p>“We start a new one every time,” said the
driver, raising his three-cornered hat once
more.</p>

<p>“And what becomes of the old ones?”
Matilda asked.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the driver, smiling, “that
depends. One never knows beforehand, things
change so nowadays. Good morning. Thank
you so much for your patronage. No, on no
account, Madam.”</p>

<p>He waved away the eightpence which
Pridmore was trying to offer him for the fare
from Brixton, and drove quickly off.</p>

<p>When they looked round them, no, this
was certainly not Streatham Common. The
wrong omnibus had brought them to a
strange village—the neatest, sweetest, reddest,
greenest, cleanest, prettiest village in the
world. The houses were grouped round a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
village green, on which children in pretty
loose frocks or smocks were playing happily.</p>

<p>Not a tight armhole was to be seen, or even
imagined in that happy spot. Matilda swelled
herself out and burst three hooks and a bit
more of the shoulder seam.</p>

<p>The shops seemed a little queer, Matilda
thought. The names somehow did not match
the things that were to be sold. For instance,
where it said “Elias Groves, Tinsmith,”
there were loaves and buns in the window,
and the shop that had “Baker” over the door,
was full of perambulators—the grocer and the
wheelwright seemed to have changed names,
or shops, or something—and Miss Skimpling,
Dressmaker or Milliner, had her shop window
full of pork and sausage meat.</p>

<p>“What a funny, nice place,” said Matilda.
“I am glad we took the wrong omnibus.”</p>

<p>A little boy in a yellow smock had come up
close to them.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said very politely,
“but all strangers are brought before the king
at once. Please follow me.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the impudence,” said Pridmore.
“Strangers, indeed! And who may
you be, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“I,” said the little boy, bowing very low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“am the Prime Minister. I know I do not
look it, but appearances are deceitful. It’s
only for a short time. I shall probably be
myself again by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Pridmore muttered something which the
little boy did not hear. Matilda caught a few
words. “Smacked,” “bed,” “bread and
water”—familiar words all of them.</p>

<p>“If it’s a game,” said Matilda to the boy,
“I should like to play.”</p>

<p>He frowned.</p>

<p>“I advise you to come at once,” he said,
so sternly that even Pridmore was a little
frightened. “His Majesty’s Palace is in this
direction.” He walked away, and Matilda
made a sudden jump, dragged her hand out of
Pridmore’s, and ran after him. So Pridmore
had to follow, still grumbling.</p>

<p>The Palace stood in a great green park
dotted with white-flowered may-bushes. It
was not at all like an English palace, St.
James’s or Buckingham Palace, for instance,
because it was very beautiful and very clean.
When they got in they saw that the Palace
was hung with green silk. The footmen had
green and gold liveries, and all the courtiers’
clothes were the same colours.</p>

<p>Matilda and Pridmore had to wait a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
moments while the King changed his sceptre
and put on a clean crown, and then they were
shown into the Audience Chamber. The King
came to meet them.</p>

<p>“It is kind of you to have come so far,” he
said. “Of <i>course</i> you’ll stay at the Palace?”
He looked anxiously at Matilda.</p>

<p>“Are you <i>quite</i> comfortable, my dear?” he
asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>Matilda was very truthful—for a girl.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “my frock cuts me round
the arms——”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he, “and you brought no
luggage—some of the Princess’s frocks—her
old ones perhaps—yes—yes—this person—your
maid, no doubt?”</p>

<p>A loud laugh rang suddenly through the
hall. The King looked uneasily round, as
though he expected something to happen.
But nothing seemed likely to occur.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Matilda, “Pridmore is—Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p>For before her eyes she saw an awful change
taking place in Pridmore. In an instant all
that was left of the original Pridmore were the
boots and the hem of her skirt—the top part of
her had changed into painted iron and glass,
and even as Matilda looked the bit of skirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a><br /><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that was left got flat and hard and square.
The two feet turned into four feet, and they
were iron feet, and there was no more Pridmore.</p>

<div class="caption">THE TOP PART OF PRIDMORE TURNED INTO PAINTED IRON AND GLASS.</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, my poor child,” said the King, “your
maid has turned into an Automatic Machine.”</p>

<p>It was too true. The maid had turned into
a machine such as those which you see in a
railway station—greedy, grasping things which
take your pennies and give you next to nothing
in chocolate and no change.</p>

<p>But there was no chocolate to be seen
through the glass of the machine that once
had been Pridmore. Only little rolls of paper.</p>

<p>The King silently handed some pennies to
Matilda. She dropped one into the machine
and pulled out the little drawer. There was
a scroll of paper. Matilda opened it and
read—</p>

<p>“Don’t be tiresome.”</p>

<p>She tried again. This time it was—</p>

<p>“If you don’t give over I’ll tell your Ma
first thing when she comes home.”</p>

<p>The next was—</p>

<p>“Go along with you do—always worrying;”
so then Matilda <i>knew</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the King sadly, “I fear there’s
no doubt about it. Your maid has turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
into an Automatic Nagging Machine. Never
mind, my dear, she’ll be all right to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I like her best like this, thank you,” said
Matilda quickly. “I needn’t put in any more
pennies, you see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we mustn’t be unkind and neglectful,”
said the King gently, and he dropped in a
penny. <i>He</i> got—</p>

<p>“You tiresome boy, you. Leave me be this
minute.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said the King wearily;
“you’ve no idea how suddenly things change
here. It’s because—but I’ll tell you all about
it at tea-time. Go with nurse now, my dear,
and see if any of the Princess’s frocks will fit
you.”</p>

<p>Then a nice, kind, cuddly nurse led Matilda
away to the Princess’s apartments, and took
off the stiff frock that hurt, and put on a green
silk gown, as soft as birds’ breasts, and Matilda
kissed her for sheer joy at being so comfortable.</p>

<p>“And now, dearie,” said the nurse, “you’d
like to see the Princess, wouldn’t you? Take
care you don’t hurt yourself with her. She’s
rather sharp.”</p>

<p>Matilda did not understand this then. Afterwards
she did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/p015.jpg" width="376" height="590" alt="Girl in garden looking at thin, tall princess" />
<div class="caption">THE PRINCESS WAS LIKE A YARD AND A HALF OF WHITE TAPE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The nurse took her through many marble
corridors and up and down many marble steps,
and at last they came to a garden full of white
roses, and in the middle of it, on a green satin-covered
eiderdown, as big as a feather bed, sat
the Princess in a white gown.</p>

<p>She got up when Matilda came towards her,
and it was like seeing a yard and a half of
white tape stand up on one end and bow—a
yard and a half of broad white tape, of
course; but what is considered broad for tape
is very narrow indeed for princesses.</p>

<p>“How are you?” said Matilda, who had
been taught manners.</p>

<p>“Very slim indeed, thank you,” said the
Princess. And she was. Her face was so white
and thin that it looked as though it were made
of an oyster-shell. Her hands were thin and
white, and her fingers reminded Matilda of
fish-bones. Her hair and eyes were black,
and Matilda thought she might have been
pretty if she had been fatter. When she
shook hands with Matilda her bony fingers
hurt quite hard.</p>

<p>The Princess seemed pleased to see her
visitor, and invited her to sit with Her Highness
on the satin cushion.</p>

<p>“I have to be very careful or I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
break,” said she; “that’s why the cushion
is so soft, and I can’t play many games for
fear of accidents. Do you know any sitting-down
games?”</p>

<p>The only thing Matilda could think of was
Cat’s-cradle, so they played that with the
Princess’s green hair-ribbon. Her fish-bony
fingers were much cleverer than Matilda’s
little fat, pink paws.</p>

<p>Matilda looked about her between the
games and admired everything very much,
and asked questions, of course. There was
a very large bird chained to a perch in the
middle of a very large cage. Indeed the cage
was so big that it took up all one side of the
rose-garden. The bird had a yellow crest like
a cockatoo and a very large bill like a toucan.
(If you do not know what a toucan is you
do not deserve ever to go to the Zoological
Gardens again.)</p>

<p>“What is that bird?” asked Matilda.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Princess, “that’s my pet
Cockatoucan; he’s very valuable. If he were
to die or be stolen the Green Land would
wither up and grow like New Cross or
Islington.”</p>

<p>“How horrible!” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been to those places, of course,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
said the Princess, shuddering, “but I hope I
know my geography.”</p>

<p>“All of it?” asked Matilda.</p>

<p>“Even the exports and imports,” said the
Princess. “Goodbye, I’m so thin I have to
rest a good deal or I should wear myself out.
Nurse, take her away.”</p>

<p>So nurse took her away to a wonderful
room, where she amused herself till tea-time
with all the kind of toys that you see and
want in the shop when some one is buying
you a box of bricks or a puzzle map—the kind
of toys you never get because they are so
expensive.</p>

<p>Matilda had tea with the King. He was
full of true politeness and treated Matilda
exactly as though she had been grown up—so
that she was extremely happy and behaved
beautifully.</p>

<p>The King told her all his troubles.</p>

<p>“You see,” he began, “what a pretty place
my Green Land was once. It has points even
now. But things aren’t what they used to
be. It’s that bird, that Cockatoucan. We
daren’t kill it or give it away. And every
time it laughs something changes. Look at
my Prime Minister. He was a six-foot man.
And look at him now. I could lift him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
one hand. And then your poor maid. It’s
all that bad bird.”</p>

<p>“Why <i>does</i> it laugh?” asked Matilda.</p>

<p>“I can’t think,” said the King; “I can’t
see anything to laugh at.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you give it lessons, or something
nasty to make it miserable?”</p>

<p>“I have, I do, I assure you, my dear child.
The lessons that bird has to swallow would
choke a Professor.”</p>

<p>“Does it eat anything else besides lessons?”</p>

<p>“Christmas pudding. But there—what’s
the use of talking—that bird would laugh if
it were fed on dog-biscuits.”</p>

<p>His Majesty sighed and passed the buttered
toast.</p>

<p>“You can’t possibly,” he went on, “have
any idea of the kind of things that happen.
That bird laughed one day at a Cabinet
Council, and all my ministers turned into
little boys in yellow socks. And we can’t get
any laws made till they come right again.
It’s not their fault, and I must keep their
situations open for them, of course, poor
things.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“There was a Dragon, now,” said the King.
“When he came I offered the Princess’s hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and half my kingdom to any one who would
kill him. It’s an offer that is always made,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“Well, a really respectable young Prince
came along, and every one turned out to see
him fight the Dragon. As much as ninepence
each was paid for the front seats, I assure
you. The trumpet sounded and the Dragon
came hurrying up. A trumpet is like a dinner-bell
to a Dragon, you know. And the Prince
drew his bright sword and we all shouted, and
then that wretched bird laughed and the
Dragon turned into a pussy-cat, and the
Prince killed it before he could stop himself.
The populace was furious.”</p>

<p>“What happened then?” asked Matilda.</p>

<p>“Well, I did what I could. I said, ‘You
shall marry the Princess just the same.’ So
I brought the Prince home, and when we got
there the Cockatoucan had just been laughing
again, and the Princess had turned into a
very old German governess. The Prince went
home in a great hurry and an awful temper.
The Princess was all right in a day or two.
These are trying times, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry for you,” said Matilda, going
on with the preserved ginger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well you may be,” said the miserable
Monarch; “but if I were to try to tell you all
that that bird has brought on my poor kingdom
I should keep you up till long past your
proper bedtime.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Matilda kindly. “Do
tell me some more.”</p>

<p>“Why,” the King went on, growing now
more agitated, “why, at one titter from that
revolting bird the long row of ancestors on
my Palace wall grew red-faced and vulgar;
they began to drop their H’s and to assert
that their name was Smith from Clapham
Junction.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful!”</p>

<p>“And once,” said the King in a whimper,
“it laughed so loudly that two Sundays came
together and next Thursday got lost, and
went prowling away and hid itself on the
other side of Christmas.”</p>

<p>“And now,” he said suddenly, “it’s
bedtime.”</p>

<p>“Must I go?” asked Matilda.</p>

<p>“Yes please,” said the King. “I tell all
strangers this tragic story because I always
feel that perhaps some stranger might be
clever enough to help me. You seem a very
nice little girl. Do you think you are clever?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very nice even to be <i>asked</i> if you are
clever. Your Aunt Willoughby knows well
enough that you are not. But kings do say
nice things. Matilda was very pleased.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am clever,” she was
saying quite honestly, when suddenly the
sound of a hoarse laugh rang through the
banqueting hall. Matilda put her hands to
her head.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she cried, “I feel so different.
Oh! wait a minute. Oh! whatever is it?
Oh!”</p>

<p>Then she was silent for a moment. Then
she looked at the King and said, “I was
wrong, your Majesty, I <i>am</i> clever, and I know
it is not good for me to sit up late. Good-night.
Thank you so much for your nice
party. In the morning I think I shall be
clever enough to help you, unless the bird
laughs me back into the other kind of
Matilda.”</p>

<p>But in the morning Matilda’s head felt
strangely clear; only when she came down
to breakfast full of plans for helping the
King, she found that the Cockatoucan must
have laughed in the night, for the beautiful
Palace had turned into a butcher’s shop, and
the King, who was too wise to fight against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Fate, had tucked up his royal robes, and was
busy in the shop weighing out six ounces of
the best mutton-chops for a child with a
basket.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how ever you can help me
now,” he said, despairingly; “as long as the
Palace stays like this, it’s no use trying to go
on with being a king, or anything. I can
only try to be a good butcher. You shall
keep the accounts if you like, till that bird
laughs me back into my Palace again.”</p>

<p>So the King settled down to business,
respected by his subjects, who had all, since
the coming of the Cockatoucan, had their
little ups and downs. And Matilda kept the
books and wrote out the bills, and really they
were both rather happy. Pridmore, disguised
as the automatic machine, stood in the shop
and attracted many customers. They used
to bring their children, and make the poor
innocents put their pennies in, and then read
Pridmore’s good advice. Some parents are
so harsh. And the Princess sat in the back
garden with the Cockatoucan, and Matilda
played with her every afternoon. But one
day, as the King was driving through another
kingdom, the King of that kingdom looked
out of one of his Palace windows, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a><br /><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
laughed as the King went by, and shouted,
“Butcher!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/p020.jpg" width="463" height="600" alt="King sitting on top tall ladder held up by four men overlooking his vast army" />
<div class="caption">THE KING SENT HIS ARMY, AND THE ENEMY WERE CRUSHED.</div>
</div>

<p>The Butcher-King did not mind this,
because it was true, however rude. But
when the other King called out, “What
price cat’s meat!” the King was very angry
indeed, because the meat he sold was always
of the best quality. When he told Matilda
all about it, she said, “Send the Army to
crush him.”</p>

<p>So the King sent his Army, and the enemy
were crushed. The Bird laughed the King
back into his throne, and laughed away the
butcher’s shop just in time for his Majesty to
proclaim a general holiday, and to organise
a magnificent reception for the Army. Matilda
now helped the King to manage everything.
She wonderfully enjoyed the new delightful
feeling of being clever, so that she felt it was
indeed too bad when the Cockatoucan laughed
just as the reception was beautifully arranged.
It laughed, and the general holiday was
turned into an income tax; the magnificent
reception changed itself to a royal reprimand,
and the Army itself suddenly became a discontented
Sunday-school treat, and had to be
fed with buns and brought home in brakes,
crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Something must be done,” said the King.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Matilda, “I’ve been thinking
if you will make me the Princess’s governess,
I’ll see what I can do. I’m quite clever
enough.”</p>

<p>“I must open Parliament to do that,” said
the King; “it’s a Constitutional change.”</p>

<p>So he hurried off down the road to open
Parliament. But the bird put its head on
one side and laughed at him as he went by.
He hurried on, but his beautiful crown grew
large and brassy, and was set with cheap
glass in the worst possible taste. His robe
turned from velvet and ermine to flannelette
and rabbit’s fur. His sceptre grew twenty
feet long and extremely awkward to carry.
But he persevered, his royal blood was up.</p>

<p>“No bird,” said he, “shall keep me from
my duty and my Parliament.”</p>

<p>But when he got there, he was so agitated
that he could not remember which was the
right key to open Parliament with, and in the
end he hampered the lock and so could not
open Parliament at all, and members of
Parliament went about making speeches in
the roads to the great hindrance of the traffic.</p>

<p>The poor King went home and burst into
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Matilda,” he said, “this is too much.
You have always been a comfort to me. You
stood by me when I was a butcher; you kept
the books; you booked the orders; you
ordered the stock. If you really are clever
enough, now is the time to help me. If you
won’t, I’ll give up the business. I’ll leave
off being a King. I’ll go and be a butcher
in the Camberwell New Road, and I will
get another little girl to keep my books, not
you.”</p>

<p>This decided Matilda. She said, “Very
well, your Majesty, then give me leave
to prowl at night. Perhaps I shall find
out what makes the Cockatoucan laugh;
if I can do that, we can take care he never
gets it, whatever it is.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the poor King, “if you could
only do that.”</p>

<p>When Matilda went to bed that night, she
did not go to sleep. She lay and waited till
all the Palace was quiet, and then she crept
softly, pussily, mousily to the garden, where
the Cockatoucan’s cage was, and she hid
behind a white rosebush, and looked and
listened. Nothing happened till it was gray
dawn, and then it was only the Cockatoucan
who woke up. But when the sun was round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and red over the Palace roof, something came
creeping, creeping, pussily, mousily out of
the Palace; and it looked like a yard and
a half of white tape creeping along; and it
was the Princess herself.</p>

<p>She came quietly up to the cage, and
squeezed herself between the bars; they were
very narrow bars, but a yard and a half of
white tape can go through the bars of any
birdcage I ever saw. And the Princess went
up to the Cockatoucan and tickled him under
his wings till he laughed aloud. Then, quick
as thought, the Princess squeezed through
the bars, and was back in her room before the
bird had finished laughing. Matilda went
back to bed. Next day all the sparrows had
turned into cart horses, and the roads were
impassable.</p>

<p>That day when she went, as usual, to
play with the Princess, Matilda said to her
suddenly, “Princess, what makes you so
thin?”</p>

<p>The Princess caught Matilda’s hand and
pressed it with warmth.</p>

<p>“Matilda,” she said simply, “you have
a noble heart. No one else has ever asked
me that, though they tried to cure it. And
I couldn’t answer till I was asked, could I?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a><br /><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a><br /><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
It’s a sad, a tragic tale, Matilda. I was once
as fat as you are.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/p023.jpg" width="405" height="600" alt="The king is now a sad, small house with a fence around him. Matilda, holding Beeton's cookbook is looking at him" />
<div class="caption">THE KING HAD TURNED INTO A VILLA RESIDENCE.</div>
</div>

<p>“I’m not so very fat,” said Matilda,
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Princess impatiently, “I
was quite fat enough anyhow. And then I
got thin—”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“Because they would not let me have my
favourite pudding every day.”</p>

<p>“What a shame!” said Matilda, “and
what is your favourite pudding?”</p>

<p>“Bread and milk, of course, sprinkled with
rose leaves—and with pear-drops in it.”</p>

<p>Of course, Matilda went at once to the
King, and while she was on her way the
Cockatoucan happened to laugh. When she
reached the King, he was in no condition for
ordering dinner, for he had turned into a villa-residence,
replete with every modern improvement.
Matilda only recognised him, as he
stood sadly in the Park, by the crown that
stuck crookedly on one of the chimney-pots,
and the border of ermine along the garden
path. So she ordered the Princess’s favourite
pudding on her own responsibility, and the
whole Court had it every day for dinner, till
there was no single courtier but loathed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
very sight of bread and milk, and there was
hardly one who would not have run a mile
rather than meet a pear-drop. Even Matilda
herself got rather tired of it, though being
clever, she knew how good bread and milk
was for her.</p>

<p>But the Princess got fatter and fatter, and
rosier and rosier. Her thread-paper gowns
had to be let out, and let out, till there were no
more turnings in left to be let out, and then
she had to wear the old ones that Matilda had
been wearing, and then to have new ones.
And as she got fatter she got kinder, till
Matilda grew quite fond of her.</p>

<p>And the Cockatoucan had not laughed for
a month.</p>

<p>When the Princess was as fat as any
Princess ought to be, Matilda went to her
one day, and threw her arms round her and
kissed her. The Princess kissed her back,
and said, “Very well, I <i>am</i> sorry then, but
I didn’t want to say so, but now I will.
And the Cockatoucan never laughs except
when he’s tickled. So there! He hates to
laugh.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t do it again,” said Matilda,
“will you?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” said the Princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
very much surprised, “why should I? I was
spiteful when I was thin, but now I’m fat
again I want every one to be happy.”</p>

<p>“But how can any one be happy?” asked
Matilda, severely, “when every one is turned
into something they weren’t meant to be?
There’s your dear father—he’s a desirable villa—the
Prime Minister was a little boy, and he
got back again, and now he’s turned into a
Comic Opera. Half the Palace housemaids
are breakers, dashing themselves against the
Palace crockery: the Navy, to a man, are
changed to French poodles, and the Army to
German sausages. Your favourite nurse is
now a flourishing steam laundry, and I, alas!
am too clever by half. Can’t that horrible
bird do anything to put us all right
again?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Princess, dissolved in tears
at this awful picture, “he told me once himself
that when he laughed he could only
change one or two things at once, and then,
as often as not, it turned out to be something
he didn’t expect. The only way to make
everything come right again would be—but
it can’t be done! If we could only make him
laugh on the wrong side of his mouth. That’s
the secret. He told me so. But I don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
what it <i>is</i>, let alone being able to do it. Could
<i>you</i> do it, Matilda?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Matilda, “but let me whisper.
He’s listening. Pridmore could. She’s often
told me she’d do it to me. But she never has.
Oh, Princess, I’ve got an idea.”</p>

<p>The two were whispering so low that the
Cockatoucan could not hear, though he tried
his hardest. Matilda and the Princess left
him listening.</p>

<p>Presently he heard a sound of wheels. Four
men came into the rose-garden wheeling a great
red thing in a barrow. They set it down in
front of the Cockatoucan, who danced on his
perch with rage.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, “if only some one would
make me laugh, that horrible thing would be
the one to change. I know it would. It
would change into something much horrider
than it is now. I feel it in all my feathers.”</p>

<p>The Princess opened the cage-door with the
Prime Minister’s key, which a tenor singer
had found at the beginning of his music. It
was also the key of the comic opera. She
crept up behind the Cockatoucan and tickled
him under both wings. He fixed his baleful
eye on the red Automatic Machine and
laughed long and loud; he saw the red iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a><br /><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and glass change before his eyes into the form
of Pridmore. Her cheeks were red with rage
and her eyes shone like glass with fury.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">

<div class="caption">FOUR MEN CAME WHEELING A GREAT RED THING ON A BARROW.</div>
</div>

<p>“Nice manners!” said she to the Cockatoucan,
“what are you laughing at, I should
like to know—I’ll make you laugh on the
wrong side of your mouth, my fine fellow!”</p>

<p>She sprang into the cage, and then and
there, before the astonished Court, she shook
that Cockatoucan till he really and truly did
laugh on the wrong side of his mouth. It was
a terrible sight to witness, and the sound of
that wrong-sided laughter was horrible to
hear.</p>

<p>But instantly all the things changed back as
if by magic to what they had been before.
The laundry became a nurse, the villa became
a king, the other people were just what they
had been before, and all Matilda’s wonderful
cleverness went out like the snuff of a
candle.</p>

<p>The Cockatoucan himself fell in two—one
half of him became a common, ordinary Toucan,
such as you must have seen a hundred
times at the Zoo, unless you are unworthy to
visit that happy place, and the other half
became a weathercock, which, as you know, is
always changing and makes the wind change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
too. So he has not quite lost his old power.
Only now he is in halves, any power he may
have has to be used without laughing. The
poor, broken Cockatoucan, like King you-know-who
in English history, has never since
that sad day smiled again.</p>

<p>The grateful King sent an escort of the
whole Army, now no longer dressed in sausage
skins, but in uniforms of dazzling beauty, with
drums and banners, to see Matilda and Pridmore
home. But Matilda was very sleepy.
She had been clever for so long that she was
quite tired out. It is indeed a very fatiguing
thing, as no doubt you know. And the
soldiers must have been sleepy too, for one by
one the whole Army disappeared, and by the
time Pridmore and Matilda reached home
there was only one left, and he was the policeman
at the corner.</p>

<p>The next day Matilda began to talk to Pridmore
about the Green Land and the Cockatoucan
and the Villa-residence-King, but Pridmore
only said—</p>

<p>“Pack of nonsense! Hold your tongue,
do!”</p>

<p>So Matilda naturally understood that Pridmore
did not wish to be reminded of the time
when she was an Automatic Nagging Machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
so of course, like a kind and polite little girl,
she let the subject drop.</p>

<p>Matilda did not mention her adventures to
the others at home because she saw that they
believed her to have spent the time with her
Great-aunt Willoughby.</p>

<p>And she knew if she had said that she had
not been there she would be sent at once—and
she did not wish this.</p>

<p>She has often tried to get Pridmore to take
the wrong omnibus again, which is the only
way she knows of getting to the Green Land;
but only once has she been successful, and then
the omnibus did not go to the Green Land at
all, but to the Elephant and Castle.</p>

<p>But no little girl ought to expect to go to
the Green Land more than once in a lifetime.
Many of us indeed are not even so fortunate
as to go there once.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is very hard, when you have been accustomed
to go to the seaside every summer
ever since you were quite little, to be made to
stay in London just because an aunt and an
uncle choose to want to come and stay at your
house to see the Royal Academy and go to the
summer sales.</p>

<p>Selim and Thomasina felt that it was very
hard indeed. And aunt and uncle were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the nice kind, either. If it had been Aunt
Emma, who dressed dolls and told fairy-tales—or
Uncle Reggie, who took you to the
Crystal Palace, and gave you five bob at a
time, and never even asked what you spent it
on, it would have been different. But it was
Uncle Thomas and Aunt Selina.</p>

<p>Aunt Selina was all beady, and sat bolt upright,
and told you to mind what you were
told, and Selim had been named after her—as
near as they could get. And Uncle Thomas
was the one Thomasina had been named after:
he was deaf, and he always told you what the
moral of everything was, and the housemaid
said he was “near.”</p>

<p>“I know he is, worse luck,” said Thomasina.</p>

<p>“I mean, miss,” explained the housemaid,
“he’s none too free with his chink.”</p>

<p>Selim groaned. “He never gave me but a
shilling in his life,” said he, “and that turned
out to be bad when I tried to change it at the
ginger-beer shop.”</p>

<p>The children could not understand why this
aunt and uncle were allowed to interfere with
everything as they did: and they quite made
up their minds that when they were grown up
they would never allow an aunt or an uncle to
cross their doorsteps. They never thought—poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
dear little things—that some day they
would grow up to be aunts and uncles in their
turn, or, at least, one of each.</p>

<p>It was very hot in London that year: the
pavement was like hot pie, and the asphalt
was like hot pudding, and there was a curious
wind that collected dust and straw and dirty
paper, and then got tired of its collection, and
threw it away in respectable people’s areas
and front gardens. The blind in the nursery
had never been fixed up since the day when
the children took it down to make a drop-scene
for a play they were going to write and
never did. So the hot afternoon sun came
burning in through the window, and the
children got hotter and hotter, and crosser
and crosser, till at last Selim slapped Thomasina’s
arms till she cried, and Thomasina
kicked Selim’s legs till he screamed.</p>

<p>Then they sat down in different corners of
the nursery and cried, and called each other
names, and said they wished they were dead.
This is very naughty indeed, as, of course, you
know; but you must remember how hot it was.</p>

<p>When they had called each other all the
names they could think of, Thomasina said,
suddenly, “All right, Silly,” (that was Selim’s
pet name)—“cheer up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s too hot to cheer up,” said Selim,
gloomily.</p>

<p>“We’ve been very naughty,” said Thomasina,
rubbing her eyes with the paint rag,
“but it’s all the heat. I heard Aunt Selina
telling mother the weather wore her nerves
to fiddle-strings. That just meant she was
cross.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s not <i>our</i> fault,” said Selim.
“People say be good and you’ll be happy.
Uncle Reggy says, ‘Be happy, and perhaps
you’ll be good.’ <i>I</i> could be good if I was
happy.”</p>

<p>“So could I,” said Thomasina.</p>

<p>“What <i>would</i> make you happy?” said a
thick, wheezy voice from the toy cupboard,
and out rolled the big green and red india-rubber
ball that Aunt Emma had sent them
last week. They had not played with it
much, because the garden was so hot and
sunny—and when they wanted to play with
it in the street, on the shady side, Aunt
Selina had said it was not like respectable
children, so they weren’t allowed.</p>

<p>Now the Ball rolled out very slowly—and
the bright light on its new paint seemed to
make it wink at them. You will think that
they were surprised to hear a ball speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Not at all. As you grow up, and more and
more strange things happen to you, you will
find that the more astonishing a thing is the
less it surprises you. (I wonder why this is.
Think it over, and write and tell me what
you think.)</p>

<p>Selim stood up, and said, “Halloa”; but
that was only out of politeness. Thomasina
answered the Ball’s question.</p>

<p>“We want to be at the seaside—and no
aunts—and none of the things we don’t like—and
no uncles, of course,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Ball, “if you think you
can be good, why not set me bouncing?”</p>

<p>“We’re not allowed in here,” said Thomasina,
“because of the crinkly ornaments people
give me on my birthdays.”</p>

<p>“Well, the street then,” said the Ball; “the
nice shady side.”</p>

<p>“It’s not like respectable children,” said
Selim sadly.</p>

<p>The Ball laughed. If you have never heard
an india-rubber ball laugh you won’t understand.
It’s the sort of quicker, quicker,
quicker, softer, softer, softer chuckle of a
bounce that it gives when it’s settling down
when you’re tired of bouncing it.</p>

<p>“The garden, then,” it said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t mind, if you’ll go on talking,” said
Selim kindly.</p>

<p>So they took the Ball down into the garden
and began to bounce it in the sun, on the dry,
yellowy grass of the lawn.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the Ball. “You do like
me!”</p>

<p>“What?” said the children.</p>

<p>“Why, do like I do—bounce!” said the
Ball. “That’s right—higher, higher, higher!”</p>

<p>For then and there the two children had
begun bouncing as if their feet were india-rubber
balls, and you have no idea what a
delicious sensation that gives you.</p>

<p>“Higher, higher,” cried the green and red
ball, bouncing excitedly. “Now, follow me,
higher, higher.” And off it bounced down
the blackened gravel of the path, and the
children bounced after it, shrieking with
delight at the new feeling. They bounced
over the wall—all three of them—and the
children looked back just in time to see Uncle
Thomas tapping at the window, and saying,
“Don’t.”</p>

<p>You have not the least idea how glorious it
is to feel full of bouncibleness; so that, instead
of dragging one foot after the other, as you do
when you feel tired or naughty, you bounce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
along, and every time your feet touch the
ground you bounce higher, and all without
taking any trouble or tiring yourself. You
have, perhaps, heard of the Greek gentleman
who got new strength every time he fell down.
His name was Antæus, and I believe he was
an india-rubber ball, green on one side where
he touched the earth, and red on the other
where he felt the sun. But enough of classical
research.</p>

<p>Thomasina and Selim bounced away, following
the Bouncible Ball. They went over
fences and walls, and through parched, dry
gardens and burning-hot streets; they passed
the region where fields of cabbages and rows
of yellow brick cottages mark the division
between London and the suburbs. They
bounced through the suburbs, dusty and
neat, with geraniums in the front gardens,
and all the blinds pulled half-way down; and
then the lamp-posts in the road got fewer
and fewer, and the fields got greener and the
hedges thicker—it was real, true country—with
lanes instead of roads; and down the
lanes the green and red Ball went bouncing,
bouncing, bouncing, and the children after it.
Thomasina, in her white, starched frock,
very prickly round the neck, and Selim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in his every-day sailor-suit, a little tight
under the arms. His Sunday one was a
size larger. No one seemed to notice them,
but they noticed and pitied the children
who were being “taken for a walk” in the
gritty suburban roads.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” they asked the
Ball, and it answered, with a sparkling green
and red smile—</p>

<p>“To the most delightful place in the world.”</p>

<p>“What’s it called?” asked Selim.</p>

<p>“It’s called Whereyouwantogoto,” the
Ball answered, and on they went. It was a
wonderful journey—up and down, looking
through the hedges and over them, looking
in at the doors of cottages, and then in at the
top windows, up and down—bounce—bounce—bounce.</p>

<p>And at last they came to the sea. And the
Bouncing Ball said, “Here you are! Now be
good, for there’s nothing here but the things
that make people happy.” And with that he
curled himself up like a ball in the shadow of
a wet sea-weedy rock, and went to sleep, for
he was tired out with his long journey. The
children stopped bouncing, and looked about
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tommy;” said Selim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a><br /><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Silly!” said Thomasina. And well
they might! In the place to which the Ball
had brought them was all that your fancy
can possibly paint, and a great deal more
beside.</p>

<p>The children feel exactly as you do when
you’ve had the long, hot, dirty train journey—and
every one has been so cross about the
boxes and the little brown portmanteau that
was left behind at the junction—and then
when you get to your lodgings you are told
that you may run down and have a look at the
sea if you’re back by tea time, and mother and
nurse will unpack.</p>

<p>Only Thomasina and her brother had not
had a tiresome journey—and there were no
nasty, stuffy lodgings for them, and no tea
with oily butter and a new pot of marmalade.</p>

<p>“There’s silver-sand,” said she—“miles of
it.”</p>

<p>“And rocks,” said he.</p>

<p>“And cliffs.”</p>

<p>“And caves in the cliffs.”</p>

<p>“And how cool it is,” said Thomasina.</p>

<p>“And yet it’s nice and warm too,” said
Selim.</p>

<p>“And what shells!”</p>

<p>“And seaweed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the downs behind!”</p>

<p>“And trees in the distance!”</p>

<p>“And here’s a dog, to go after sticks. Here,
Rover, Rover.”</p>

<p>A big black dog answered at once to the
name, because he was a retriever, and they
are all called Rover.</p>

<p>“And spades!” said the girl.</p>

<p>“And pails!” said the boy.</p>

<p>“And what pretty sea-poppies,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“And a basket—and grub in it!” said the
boy. So they sat down and had lunch.</p>

<p>It was a lovely lunch. Lobsters and ice-creams
(strawberry and pine-apple), and toffee
and hot buttered toast and ginger-beer. They
ate and ate, and thought of the aunt and uncle
at home, and the minced veal and sago pudding,
and they were very happy indeed.</p>

<p>Just as they were finishing their lunch they
saw a swirling, swishing, splashing commotion
in the green sea a little way off, and they tore
off their clothes and rushed into the water to
see what it was. It was a seal. He was very
kind and convenient. He showed them how
to swim and dive.</p>

<p>“But won’t it make us ill to bathe so soon
after meals? Isn’t it wrong?” asked
Thomasina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 484px;">
<img src="images/p036.jpg" width="484" height="352" alt="Two children in swimsuits talking to seal at shore" />
<div class="caption">THE SEAL WAS VERY KIND AND CONVENIENT.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a><br /><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the seal. “Nothing is
wrong here—as long as you’re good. Let me
teach you water-leapfrog—a most glorious
game, so cool, yet so exciting. You try
it.”</p>

<p>At last the seal said: “I suppose you wear
man-clothes. They’re very inconvenient. My
two eldest have just outgrown their coats. If
you’ll accept them——”</p>

<p>And it dived, and came up with two golden
sealskin coats over its arm, and the children
put them on.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” they said. “You
<i>are</i> kind.”</p>

<p>I am almost sure that it has never been
your luck to wear a fur coat that fitted you
like a skin, and that could not be spoiled with
sand or water, or jam, or bread and milk, or
any of the things with which you mess up the
nice new clothes your kind relations buy for
you. But if you like, you may try to imagine
how jolly the little coats were.</p>

<p>Thomasina and Selim played all day on the
beach, and when they were tired then went
into a cave, and found supper—salmon and
cucumber, and welsh-rabbit and lemonade—and
then they went to bed in a great heap of
straw and grass and fern and dead leaves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
all the delightful things you have often wished
to sleep in. Only you have never been
allowed to.</p>

<p>In the morning there were plum-pudding
for breakfast, and roast duck and lemon jelly,
and the day passed like a happy dream, only
broken by surprising and delightful meals.
The Ball woke up and showed them how to
play water-polo; and they bounced him on the
sand, with shrieks of joy and pleasure. You
know, a Ball likes to be bounced by people he
is fond of—it is like slapping a friend on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>There were no houses in “Whereyouwantogoto,”
and no bathing machines or bands, no
nursemaids or policemen or aunts or uncles.
You could do exactly what you liked as long as
you were good.</p>

<p>“What will happen if we’re naughty?”
Selim asked. The Ball looked very grave,
and answered—</p>

<p>“I must not tell you; and I very strongly
advise you not to try to find out.”</p>

<p>“We won’t—indeed, we won’t,” said they,
and went off to play rounders with the rabbits
on the downs—who were friendly fellows, and
very keen on the game.</p>

<p>On the third evening Thomasina was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
silent, and the Ball said, “What’s the matter,
girl-bouncer? Out with it.”</p>

<p>So she said, “I was wondering how
mother is, and whether she has one of her
bad headaches.”</p>

<p>The Ball said, “Good little girl! Come
with me and I’ll show you something.”</p>

<p>He bounced away, and they followed him,
and he flopped into a rocky pool, frightening
the limpets and sea-anemones dreadfully,
though he did not mean to.</p>

<p>“Now look,” he called from under the
water, and the children looked, and the pool
was like a looking-glass, only it was not their
own faces they saw in it.</p>

<p>They saw the drawing-room at home, and
father and mother, who were both quite well,
only they looked tired—and the aunt and
uncle were there—and Uncle Thomas was
saying, “What a blessing those children are
away.”</p>

<p>“Then they know where we are?” said
Selim to the Ball.</p>

<p>“They think they know,” said the Ball,
“or you think they think they know. Anyway,
they’re happy enough. Good-night.”</p>

<p>And he curled himself up like a ball in his
favourite sleeping-place. The two children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
crept into their pleasant, soft, sweet nest of
straw and leaves and fern and grass, and went
to sleep. But Selim was vexed with Thomasina
because she had thought of mother before he
had, and he said she had taken all the fern—and
they went to sleep rather cross. They
woke crosser. So far they had both helped to
make the bed every morning, but to-day neither
wanted to.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I should make the
beds,” said he; “it’s a girl’s work, not a
boy’s.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I should do it,” said
Thomasina; “it’s a servant’s place, not a
young lady’s.”</p>

<p>And then a very strange and terrible thing
happened. Quite suddenly, out of nothing
and out of nowhere, appeared a housemaid—large
and stern and very neat indeed, and she
said—</p>

<p>“You are quite right, miss; it is my place
to make the beds. And I am instructed to
see that you are both in bed by seven.”</p>

<p>Think how dreadful this must have been to
children who had been going to bed just when
they felt inclined. They went out on to the
beach.</p>

<p>“You see what comes of being naughty,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
said Thomasina; and Selim said, “Oh, shut
up, do!”</p>

<p>They cheered up towards dinner-time—it
was roast pigeons that day and bread sauce,
and whitebait and syllabubs—and for the rest
of the day they were as good as gold, and very
polite to the Ball. Selim told it all about the
dreadful apparition of the housemaid, and it
shook its head (I know <i>you’ve</i> never seen a
ball do that, and very likely you never will)
and said—</p>

<p>“My Bouncible Boy, you may be happy
here for ever and ever if you’re contented
and good. Otherwise—well, it’s a quarter to
seven—you’ve got to go.”</p>

<p>And, sure enough, they had to. And the
housemaid put them to bed, and washed them
with yellow soap, and some of it got in their
eyes. And she lit a night-light, and sat with
them till they went to sleep, so that they
couldn’t talk, and were ever so much longer
getting to sleep than they would have been if
she had not been there. And the beds were
iron, with mattresses and hot, stuffy, fluffy
sheets and many more new blankets than they
wanted.</p>

<p>The next day they got out as early as they
could and played water football with the seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and the Bouncible Ball, and when dinner-time
came it was lobster and ices. But
Thomasina was in a bad temper. She said,
“I wish it was duck.” And before the words
had left her lips it was cold mutton and rice-pudding,
and they had to sit up to table and
eat it properly too, and the housemaid came
round to see that they didn’t leave any bits
on the edges of their plates, or talk with their
mouths full.</p>

<p>There were no more really nice meals after
that, only the sort of things you get at home.
But it is possible to be happy even without
really nice meals. But you have to be very
careful. The days went by pleasantly enough.
All the sea and land creatures were most kind
and attentive. The seal taught them all it
knew, and was always ready to play with them.
The star-fish taught them astronomy, and the
jelly-fish taught them fancy cooking. The
limpets taught them dancing as well as they
could for their lameness. The sea-birds taught
them to make nests—a knowledge they have
never needed to apply—and if the oysters did
not teach them anything it was only because
oysters are so very stupid, and not from any
lack of friendly feeling.</p>

<p>The children bathed every day in the sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a><br /><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a><br /><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and if they had only been content with this all
would have been well. But they weren’t.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 539px;">
<img src="images/p041.jpg" width="539" height="324" alt="a bathing house rising out of the sand with a sign: YOU MUST NOT BATHE ANY MORE EXCEPT THROUGH ME!" />
<div class="caption">A LONG, POINTED THING CAME SLOWLY UP OUT OF THE SAND.</div>
</div>

<p>“Let’s dig a bath,” said Selim, “and the
sea will come in and fill it, and then we can
bathe in it.”</p>

<p>So they fetched their spades and dug—and
there was no harm in that, as you very
properly remark.</p>

<p>But when the hole was finished, and the sea
came creep, creep, creeping up—and at last a
big wave thundered up the sand and swirled
into the hole, Thomasina and Selim were
struggling on the edge, fighting which should
go in first, and the wave drew sandily back
into the sea, and neither of them had bathed
in the new bath. And now it was all wet and
sandy, and its nice sharp edges rounded off,
and much shallower. And as they looked at
it angrily, the sandy bottom of the bath stirred
and shifted and rose up, as if some great sea-beast
were heaving underneath with his broad
back. The wet sand slipped back in slabs at
each side, and a long pointed thing like a thin
cow’s back came slowly up. It showed broader
and broader, and presently the flakes of wet
sand were dropping heavily off the top of a
brand-new bathing machine that stood on the
sand over where their bath had been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Selim, “we’ve done it this
time.”</p>

<p>They certainly had, for on the door of the
bathing machine was painted: “You must
not bathe any more except through me.”</p>

<p>So there was no more running into the sea
just when and how they liked. They had to
use the bathing machine, and it smelt of stale
salt water and other people’s wet towels.</p>

<p>After this the children did not seem to care
so much about the seaside, and they played
more on the downs, where the rabbits were
very kind and hospitable, and in the woods,
where all sorts of beautiful flowers grew wild—and
there was nobody to say “Don’t” when
you picked them. The children thought of
what Uncle Thomas would have said if he
had been there, and they were very, very
happy.</p>

<p>But one day Thomasina had pulled a lot of
white convolvulus and some pink geraniums
and calceolarias—the kind you are never
allowed to pick at home—and she had
made a wreath of them and put it on her
head.</p>

<p>Then Selim said, “You <i>are</i> silly! You
look like a Bank Holiday.”</p>

<p>And his sister said, “I can’t help it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
They’d look lovely on a hat, if they were
only artificial. I wish I had a hat.”</p>

<p>And she had. A large stiff hat that hurt
her head just where the elastic was sewn on,
and she had her stiff white frock that
scratched, her tiresome underclothing, all of
it, and stockings and heavy boots; and
Selim had his sailor suit—the every-day one
that was too tight in the arms; and they
had to wear them always, and their fur coats
were taken away.</p>

<p>They went sadly, all stiff and uncomfortable,
and told the Bouncible Ball. It looked
very grave, and great tears of salt water rolled
down its red and green cheeks as it sat by
the wet, seaweed-covered rock.</p>

<p>“Oh, you silly children,” it said, “haven’t
you been warned enough? You’ve everything
a reasonable child could wish for. Can’t you
be contented?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can,” they said—and so
they were—for a day and a half. And then
it wasn’t exactly discontent but real naughtiness
that brought them to grief.</p>

<p>They were playing on the downs by the
edge of the wood under the heliotrope tree.
A hedge of camellia bushes cast a pleasant
shadow, and out in the open sunlight on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
downs the orchids grew like daisies, and the
carnations like buttercups. All about was
that kind of turf on which the gardener does
not like you to play, and they had pulled
armfuls of lemon verbena and made a bed
of it. But Selim’s blouse was tight under
the arms. So when Thomasina said—</p>

<p>“Oh, Silly dear, how beautiful it is, just
like fairyland,” he said—</p>

<p>“Silly yourself. There’s no such thing as
fairyland.”</p>

<p>Just then a fairy, with little bright wings
the colour of a peacock’s tail, fluttered across
the path, and settled on a magnolia flower.</p>

<p>“Oh! Silly darling,” cried Thomasina,
“it <i>is</i> fairyland, and there’s a fairy, such a
beautiful dear. Look—there she goes.”</p>

<p>But Selim would not look—he turned over
and hid his eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing as fairyland, I tell
you,” he grunted, “and I don’t believe in
fairies.”</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly and very horribly
the fairy turned into a policeman—because
every one knows there are such things as
policemen, and any one can believe in
<i>them</i>.</p>

<p>And all the rare and beautiful flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a><br /><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
withered up and disappeared, and only thorns
and thistles were left, and the misty, twiny
trim little grass path that led along the top
of the cliffs turned into a parade, and the
policeman walked up and down it incessantly,
and watched the children at their play, and
you know how difficult it is to play when
any one is watching you, especially a policeman.
Selim was extremely vexed: that was
why, he said, there couldn’t possibly be glow-worms
as big as bicycle lamps, which, of
course, there were in “Whereyouwantogoto.”
It was after that that the gas-lamps were put
all along the parade, and a pier sprang up
on purpose to be lighted with electricity, and
a band played, because it is nonsense to have
a pier without a band.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/p044.jpg" width="468" height="460" alt="Children now fully dressed building a sand castle while a policeman struts by" />
<div class="caption">IT IS DIFFICULT TO PLAY WHEN ANY ONE IS WATCHING YOU, ESPECIALLY
A POLICEMAN.</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, you naughty, silly children,” said the
Bouncible Ball, turning red with anger,
except in the part where he was green with
disgust; “it makes me bounce with rage to
see how you’ve thrown away your chances,
and what a seaside resort you’re making of
‘Whereyouwantogoto.’”</p>

<p>And he did bounce, angrily, up and down
the beach till the housemaid looked out of
the cave and told the children not to be so
noisy, and the policeman called out—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now then, move along there, move along.
You’re obstructing of the traffic.”</p>

<p>And now I have something to tell you
which you will find it hard to make any
excuses for. I can’t make any myself. I
can only ask you to remember how hard it
is to be even moderately good, and how easy
it is to be extremely naughty.</p>

<p>When the Bouncible Ball stopped bouncing,
Selim said—</p>

<p>“I wonder what makes him bounce.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, <i>don’t!</i>” cried Thomasina, for she
had heard her brother wonder that about
balls before, and she knew all too well what
it ended in.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>don’t</i>,” she said, “oh, Silly, he
brought us here, he’s been so kind.” But
Selim said, “Nonsense; balls can’t feel, and
it will be almost as good to play with after
I’ve looked inside it.”</p>

<p>And then, before Thomasina could prevent
him, he pulled out the knife Uncle Reggy
gave him last holiday but one, and catching
the Ball up, he plunged the knife into its
side. The Bouncible Ball uttered one whiffing
squeak of pain and grief, then with a low,
hissing sigh its kindly spirit fled, and it lay,
a lifeless mass of paint and india-rubber in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the hands of its assassin. Thomasina burst
into tears—but the heartless Selim tore open
the Ball, and looked inside. You know well
enough what he found there. Emptiness;
the little square patch of india-rubber that
makes the hard lump on the outside of the
ball which you feel with your fingers when
the ball is alive and his own happy, bouncing,
cheerful self.</p>

<p>The children stood looking at each other.</p>

<p>“I—I almost wish I hadn’t,” said Selim
at last; but before Thomasina could answer
he had caught her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, look,” he cried, “look at the sea.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a dreadful sight. The
beautiful dancing, sparkling blue sea was
drying up before their eyes—in less than a
moment it was quite flat and dusty. It
hurriedly laid down a couple of railway lines,
ran up a signal-box and telegraph-poles, and
became the railway at the back of their house
at home.</p>

<p>The children, gasping with horror, turned
to the downs. From them tall, yellow brick
houses were rising, as if drawn up by an
invisible hand. Just as treacle does in cold
weather if you put your five fingers in and
pulled them up. But, of course, you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
never allowed to do this. The beach got
hard—it was a pavement. The green downs
turned grey—they were slate roofs—and
Thomasina and Selim found themselves at
the iron gate of their own number in the
terrace—and there was Uncle Thomas at
the window knocking for them to come in,
and Aunt Selina calling out to them how far
from respectable it was to play in the streets.</p>

<p>They were sent to bed at once—that was
Aunt Selina’s suggestion—and Uncle Thomas
arranged that they should have only dry
bread for tea.</p>

<p>Selim and Thomasina have never seen
“Whereyouwantogoto” again, nor the Bouncible
Ball—not even his poor body—and they
don’t deserve to either. Of course, Thomasina
was not so much to blame as Selim, but she
was punished just the same. I can’t help that.
This is really the worst of being naughty.
You not only have to suffer for it yourself,
but some one else always has to suffer too,
generally the person who loves you best.</p>

<p>You are intelligent children, and I will not
insult you with a moral. I am not Uncle
Thomas. Nor will I ask you to remember
what I have told you. I am not Aunt
Selina.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">THE BLUE MOUNTAIN</div>


<p class="drop-cap">TONY was young Tony, and old Tony
was his grandfather. This story is about
young Tony, and no human being believes a
word of it, unless young Tony does.</p>

<p>Tony was born in the town of Antioch.
This is not the same Antioch that you read
about in history, but quite a different place.
It was a place where nearly every one was
very dark as to the complexion, and rather
short as to the temper and figure. People
who were fair in the face and easy in the
temper were not thought much of in Antioch.
When Tony’s mother saw that her baby was
as fair as a daffodil and as good as gold, and
laughed all day, she said, “Oh dear, oh dear, I
suppose he takes after his grandfather, he is
not in the least like <i>my</i> family,” and the
matter annoyed her so much that she died.</p>

<p>Then there was only old Tony left to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
after young Tony, because his father had been
killed in the wars—-only a few weeks before.</p>

<p>The people of Antioch were always fighting
the neighbouring tribes, red-faced savages who
deserved no better fate than to be killed, only,
of course, sometimes a few Antiochians had to
be killed too, because that is part of the game,
and if there were no danger there would be no
glory, would there?</p>

<p>Little Tony’s hair remained yellow, and his
habit of laughing grew with his years, and he
learned his lessons and he learned his play.
He was excellent company, and if it had not
been for the yellowness of his hair and the
gentleness of his nature, he would have been
quite popular among his schoolmates.</p>

<p>His grandfather called him “gentle,” but
the people of Antioch called him “lazy,” for
they, as I said, were very black, and generally
angry. They scurried up and down in their
rocky little city, and always they seemed to
be driven by most urgent affairs, hurrying to
keep important appointments. They ran
about all day long, attending to their business,
and hardly stopping even for their dinner or
their tea, and no one ever saw any of them
asleep.</p>

<p>“Why is it, Grandfather?” young Tony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a><br /><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a><br /><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
asked one day, “what is it all about? why do
they never sit down quietly like you and me?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/p049.jpg" width="440" height="527" alt="grumpy people rushing up and down street" />
<div class="caption">THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOCH WERE ALWAYS IN A HURRY AND GENERALLY
ANGRY.</div>
</div>

<p>“It is the great heart of the Nation, my
boy,” said old Tony, “it cannot be still; it is
in the breed, you know, they can’t help it.
They are all alike too, except you and me.
Why, bless your heart, look at the King, he is
more in a hurry than all the rest, and more—and
more noble and active, bless him.”</p>

<p>The old man ended his speech in quite a
different voice from the one he had begun
with. This was because he suddenly caught
the glitter of the King’s crown as the Monarch
popped round the corner.</p>

<p>The King of Antioch was always in a hurry,
always running somewhere or other, consequently
he was seldom on his throne, and
his loyal subjects had to look out very sharply,
for he was always sure to be where they least
expected him. You may think that they
could have got over this little difficulty by
always looking for the King where they least
expected him, but if you try this simple
experiment for yourself with your governess
or tutor, or even your nurse, I think you will
find that it is not so easy as it looks.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said the King, standing in the
doorway and laughing cheerfully, “talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
treason, eh? well, you know what the punishment
for that is. Pinching with black pincers,
you know, till—well—till you don’t feel the
pinching any more.”</p>

<p>“Aha! your Majesty always has such a
pleasant way with you,” said old Tony
politely; and young Tony decided that when
he grew up he would try not to have any
pleasant ways at all.</p>

<p>The King rustled quickly round the little
house, and looked at everything—dresser,
chairs, plates and pots. He was sorry that
there was nothing that he could find fault
with, so he said, “Beware of Luxury,” and
hurried off to make his presence felt in some
other humble home. There was no pride
about King Anthony XXIII. He just dropped
in without an invitation and took his subjects
as he found them.</p>

<p>“King Anthony XXIII. is the noblest of
monarchs,” said old Tony, as he and his
grandson sat down to their plain supper.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, grandfather, he has quite
gone, he’s not listening—for a wonder!” said
young Tony.</p>

<p>Meantime the King was hurrying in and
out and up and down the crowded streets of
his city, picking up little bits of information,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and making his subjects feel that his kingship
was not a mere matter of form, but that he
was really interested in the most humble life
among his people.</p>

<p>It was a strange town, all up-hill and down-hill,
with steep rocks and precipices all mixed
up with the public streets. The people, for
all their busy habits, had no trade, or rather
they did not manufacture anything. They
built houses, and brought up their families.
They wrapped their children up very snugly
and carried them about at an earlier age than
we consider safe, and they milked their cows,
which were large and green and had wings,
and they drank the milk, and they gathered
the fruit of the trees that grew on the plain
below the town, and they got on very well
indeed. There was only one drawback to life
in Antioch, and that was its uncertainty. At
any moment an earthquake might occur, then
down would go half the town, and the busy
citizens had it all to build again. They soon
did it, for they were nothing if not industrious.
A much more awful thing was the storm of
hot rain that now and then fell on the town, a
blighting rain that killed all it touched. This
was more dreaded than even the earthquakes,
but fortunately it very seldom happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Tony was beadle and sexton and keeper
of the town records; and very nicely he kept
them too. There was not a speck of dirt on
one of them. He used to spend hours and
hours polishing the records, and he scoured
the tombstones till they shone again; and he
had most of the inscriptions by heart. After
an earthquake he was always most careful to
put the tombstones back in their proper places,
and one day, when he was doing this, he came
on a stone he did not remember to have seen
before. He called to young Tony, who had
had a Board School education, to see if he
could read the bits of words that were carved
upon it.</p>

<p>“It seems like a foreign language,” said he.</p>

<p>“I can’t make it out,” said young Tony,
“it is not carved, it is in the stone somehow.
Looks as if it were coming through from the
other side.”</p>

<p>He turned the stone over, and there, on the
other side, was an inscription which both of
them had read a hundred times.</p>

<div class="verse">“HERE LIES HENRY BIRKBECK,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">MAGICIAN TO THE INSTITUTE,</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">However humble he seems to you,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His last foretelling is going to come true.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">P.S.—You see if it doesn’t.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear me,” said old Tony. “Poor old
Henry Birkbeck, it seems like yesterday; yes,
he was very respectable, but only in a small
way of business. A magician he was by trade,
but no one thought much of him, except
perhaps the King, and <i>he</i> never gave him a
lift. He used to do things with eggs and a
hat. He broke the eggs as often as not. And
the goldfish and handkerchief he hardly ever
brought off.”</p>

<p>Old Tony began to lay down the tombstone,
but young Tony held it up with one hand and
tried to scrape the back of it with the other.</p>

<p>“There’s something here,” he said, “let’s
set it upright instead of laying it down, and I
will scrub it and see what the letters are.
Poor old Mr. Birkbeck, I wonder what his last
foretelling was. Was he good at prophesying,
grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said the sexton, “and to do
him justice he almost gave it up in his later
years. You see people laughed at him so,
because the things that he foretold never
happened. Towards the end he grew very
feeble—hardly prophesied a single prophecy
from one year’s end to another. Sometimes
he would say, ‘I should not wonder if it rained
before Sunday,’ but then he never wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
at anything. He was a calm old man, was poor
Henry. It took a good deal to astonish him.”</p>

<p>Young Tony tried to interest his boy friends
in the back of poor old Henry Birkbeck’s tombstone,
but nobody cared. They were all in too
much of a hurry to care for an occupation so
slow as cleaning tombstones, but Tony worked
away perseveringly. He cleaned it with soap,
and he cleaned it with soda, with brickdust
and vinegar, with rotten stone and washleather,
with patience and elbow grease, and the last
two, as you know, will clean almost anything.
So after a time a few letters began to show
distinctly here and there, and presently Tony
found he could read whole words.</p>

<p>There was “milk” and “mountain,” and
a word that looked like “Jilk,” only of course
it could not be that. And the last word of all
was “reign,” and the second word of all was
“Tony.”</p>

<p>“It must be something to do with me,”
said young Tony, “because of my name being
in it.”</p>

<p>“It must have something to do with the
King,” said old Tony, “because it says
‘reign,’ so you’d better cut off to the
Palace, and look sharp about it, or His
Majesty will know the reason why.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>So Tony looked sharp about it, and got to
the Palace in less than five minutes. For a
wonder the King was not engaged in dropping
in on his subjects, but was on his throne amid
his fussy black courtiers, who were all busy
trying to make themselves as small as they
could.</p>

<p>This was because the King was very short,
though he did not like to say so. He always
had himself described in the Census and the
Palace Reports as a “powerful man of middle
height,” though he was nowhere near the
middle height, and no more powerful than
other people.</p>

<p>“Well, boy,” said King Anthony XXIII.,
“what have you come here for?”</p>

<p>“There is a prophecy,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“There are a good many,” said King
Anthony, “but they don’t amount to much
since poor Henry Birkbeck died. He was
something like a prophet,” he went on,
turning to his courtiers; “he foretold, when
I was only a baby, that if I grew up I should
perhaps be king. The late King, my father,
was very pleased, I remember.”</p>

<p>The courtiers all bowed, and said it was
really wonderful. Tony said,</p>

<p>“Well, then you’d better come and have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
look at this prophecy, because it is the late
Mr. Birkbeck’s last one, and he said it’ll come
true.”</p>

<p>“Bring it here, can’t you?” said the King.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” said the boy. “It’s on his
tombstone, so there. I can’t carry tombstones
about.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the King thoughtfully, “of
course you are not powerfully built. You
are nowhere near the medium height.”</p>

<p>“Come and look at it if you want to,” said
Tony. “I’m in no hurry.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said King Anthony, “I don’t care
if I do. I’m tired of sitting still.”</p>

<p>So off they all went, King, Court, heralds,
men-at-arms, banner-bearers and spearmen,
down the narrow, dark, crooked town streets,
till they came to the churchyard where the
tombstones were—both the upright and the
flat kind.</p>

<p>Tony ran on ahead and knelt in front of the
tombstone. Then he jumped up and called out,</p>

<p>“You hurry up, it’s as plain now as the
nose on your face.”</p>

<p>“You should say the royal nose on your
Majesty’s royal face,” said old Tony anxiously.</p>

<p>But the King was too interested to care
about even his subjects’ manners.</p>

<p>He came up to the tombstone, and on it he
read, and Tony read, and all the courtiers
read:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“When Tony drinks the Blue Mountain’s milk</div>

</div></div>

<p>The King read this, and said—</p>

<p>“Well, I never!”</p>

<p>And all the courtiers said the same.</p>

<p>“Tony means Me,” said the King.</p>

<p>The courtiers said that of course it did.</p>

<p>“I am King Tony XXIII.,” said he.</p>

<p>And the courtiers said of course he was.</p>

<p>They all spoke at once like a chorus.</p>

<p>“I was christened Anthony, of course,” his
restless Majesty went on, fidgeting with his
gold collar; “but I know that my subjects
have always spoken of me behind my back by
the endearing diminutive.”</p>

<p>The courtiers assured the King that this
was so.</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s no one else called Tony?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The King turned a threatening glance on the
crowd, and every one hastened to say “No,
there wasn’t.” But old Tony turned extremely
pale, and hurrying into the vestry, he tampered
with the register of births, and altered his own
name to Sydney Cecil Ernest Watchett.</p>

<p>But young Tony spoke up. “My name’s
Tony,” said he.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it?” said His Majesty. “We’ll
soon see about that. Guards, seize him!
Now, what is your name?”</p>

<p>“Tony,” said he.</p>

<p>“Your name is not Tony,” said the King,
“your name is——” he could not think of a
name at the moment, so he stopped.</p>

<p>Tony said, “My name is Tony.”</p>

<p>“Take him to the Parliament House,” said
the King, beside himself with rage. “Give
him a taste of the Mace,” and Tony tasted
the Mace and was stamped on by the Great
Seal, who was very fierce and lived in a cage
at the Parliament House, until he was stiff
and sore and sorry enough to be glad to say
that his name was anything the King liked,
except Tony, which of course it never, never
could have been. He admitted at last that his
name was William Waterbury Watchett, and
was discharged with a caution.</p>

<div class="caption">TONY WAS STAMPED ON BY THE GREAT SEAL, WHO WAS

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“But my name <i>is</i> Tony after all,” he said
to himself as he went home, full of sad
memories of the Mace and the Great Seal.
“I wonder where the Blue Mountain is?”</p>

<p>Young Tony thought a good deal about poor
Henry Birkbeck’s prophecy. Perhaps the Great
Seal had stamped it on his memory. Anyway
he could not forget it, and all the next day he
was wandering about on the steep edge of the
town, looking out over the landscape below.
It was not an interesting landscape. All
round the brown hill where the town was
lay the vast forests of green trees, something
like bamboos, whose fruit the people ate; and
beyond that one could see the beginnings of a
still larger forest, where none of the people of
Antioch had ever dared to go—the forest,
whose leaves were a hundred times as big as
the King himself, and the trunks of the trees
as big as whole countries. Above all was the
blue sky—but, look as Tony would, he could
see no blue mountain.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he saw the largest forest
shake and shiver—its enormous leaves swaying
this way and that.</p>

<p>“It must be an earthquake,” said Tony,
trembling, but he did not run away. And his
valour was rewarded as valour deserves to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
The next moment the vast branches of the
enormous forest parted, and a giant figure
came out into the forest of bamboo-like
trees. It was a figure more gigantic than
Tony had ever imagined possible. It had
long yellow hair. In its hand it carried a
great white bowl, big enough to float a navy
in. If such an expression did not sound
rather silly, I should say that this figure
gave Tony the idea of a little-girl-giant. It
sat down among the bamboo forest, crushing
millions of trees as it sat. With a spoon
twice the length of the King’s banqueting
hall, it began to eat out of the tremendous
basin. Tony saw great lumps, like blocks of
soft marble, balanced on the vast spoon, and
he knew that the giant-little-girl was eating
giant-bread-and-milk. And she wore a giant
frock, and the frock was blue. Then Tony
understood. This was the “Blue Mountain,”
and in that big big sea of a basin there was
milk—the Blue Mountain’s milk.</p>

<p>Tony stood still for a moment, then turned
and ran as hard as he could straight into the
Royal presence. To be more exact, he ran
into the Royal waistcoat, for the King, in a
hurry, as usual, was coming out of his palace
gates with a rush. The King was extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a><br /><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a><br /><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
annoyed. He refused to listen to a word Tony
had to say until Parliament had been called
together, and had passed a Bill strengthening
the enactments against cheek. Then he
allowed Tony to tell his tale. And when the
tale was told every one ran to the battlements
of the town to look. There was no blue
mountain to be seen.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/p058.jpg" width="345" height="600" alt="Girl holding large bowl" />
<div class="caption">THE GIANT-LITTLE-GIRL.</div>
</div>

<p>Then his Majesty told Tony what he
thought of him, and it was not pleasant
hearing.</p>

<p>“I am not a liar,” said Tony; “I am very
sorry I told you anything about it; I might
jolly well have gone and got it for myself.
<i>My</i> name is——William——Waterbury——Watchett.”
He stopped in confusion.</p>

<p>“I should think it was,” said the King;
“if there is any mountain, which I don’t for
a moment believe, you had better go and
fetch me some of the milk (not that I think
there is any) out of the mountain’s basin
(which I cannot believe exists outside of your
imagination). If you bring it to this address
you will be suitably rewarded.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Tony; “shall I fetch it in
a jug, or will they lend me a can?”</p>

<p>“I will lend you my mug,” said the King;
“and mind you bring it back full.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>So Tony took the mug. It had “For a
good little King. A present from Antwerp,”
on it. And he kissed his grandfather, and
started off on his long, perilous journey.</p>

<p>“I suppose he will give me a reward if I
get it,” he thought, “and if not, well, it’s an
adventure, anyway.”</p>

<p>He passed through the crowded streets,
where every one was rushing about in the
usual frantic haste, and out at the town gates,
and down the road into the forest. The trunks
of the trees towered tall and straight above,
and a subdued green light shone all about him.</p>

<p>The ground was very broken and uneven,
and often Tony had to go a long way round
to avoid some great rock or chasm. But he
travelled fast, for he was a quick walker, and
he did not miss the way once, although,
of course, it was quite a strange country to
him.</p>

<p>There had been evening classes at his
school to teach the boys the art of finding
their way in strange places, and Tony had
attended all the lectures and taken notice as
well as notes. And now he was able to
practise what he had learned, and he was glad
he had not wasted his time in drawing pictures
of the masters, or playing nibs with the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
next him, and throwing ink pellets at more
studious boys.</p>

<p>But the journey was longer than he
expected, and the mug was rather in his way.
He was very much afraid of breaking that
mug: it is an awkward thing to break a mug
with “A present for a good King” on it. It
is so difficult to replace. There are very
few of those mugs made nowadays. There is
little or no demand for them.</p>

<p>But at last the green light of the forest
began to grow brighter, and Tony saw that
he was approaching a sort of clearing among
the trees, so he put his best foot foremost,
without stopping to think which was his worst
foot—always a mistake when you are tired
and footsore.</p>

<p>And now he came out from under the
tall branches, and saw a round open space in
the forest, where millions of fallen trees lay
on the ground. And he knew that this was
the spot where the mountain had sat down
to eat its unimaginable enormous breakfast.
But there was no mountain to be seen, and
Tony knew that he could do nothing but sit
down and wait, in the hope that the Blue
Mountain would come next morning to eat its
breakfast in the same place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>So he looked about for a place to rest safely
in, and presently found just what he wanted—a
little cave, whose walls and roof were of
dried earth—and there he stayed all that
day and night, eating the fruit of the fallen
trees.</p>

<p>And next morning there was a rustling and
a swaying of the trees, and the Blue Mountain
came striding over the tall tree-tops, bending
down the forest as she came on colossal black
legs and massive shoes with monstrous ankle
straps. Each shoe was big enough to have
crushed a hundred Tonys at one step. So he
hid in his cave, and presently knew by the
shaking of the ground, like an earthquake,
that the mountain had sat down.</p>

<p>Then he came out. He was too near to see
the mountain properly, but he saw a great
blue-fold of giant frock near him, and far
above him towered the blue heights of the
giant-little-girl’s knees. On the summit of
these shone a vast white round—the great
bread-and-milk basin.</p>

<p>Tony started to climb the blue-fold. It was
stiff, starched—with giant starch, I suppose—and
it bore his weight easily. But it was a
long climb, and he drew a deep breath of
thankfulness when he reached the broad table-land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the giant-little-girl’s knees—and now
the smooth china roundness of the big basin
was before him. He tried its polished surface
again and again, and always fell back baffled.
Then he saw that he might climb up the
sleeve of the gigantic arm whose hand held
the basin. With his heart in his mouth he
began the ascent, slowly and carefully, holding
the precious mug closely to his breast. His
breath came faster and faster as he went up
and up, and at last stood triumphantly on the
edge of the great blue sleeve. From there to
the edge of the basin it was easy to crawl, and
now at last he stood on the giddy verge of the
monstrous basin, and looked down at the lake
of milk with the rocks of bread in it, many
feet below. The great height made him
giddy. He lost his footing, and still clasping
the mug, he fell headlong into the giant-bread-and-milk.
The bread rocks were fortunately
soft. Tony picked himself up. He was wet,
but no bones were broken, and the mug—oh,
joy! the mug was safe. Tony looked it over
anxiously as he sat on a rock, a sloppy and
uncertain resting place. There was only one
small crack near the handle, and Tony was
almost sure that that had been there before.</p>

<p>“I don’t know however I shall get out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
again,” said Tony; “perhaps I never shall,
but in case I do, I suppose I had better fill
the mug”; so he stooped from the rocks and
filled the mug from the lake of milk, which
was much thicker than the milk of the green
cows with wings, the only milk Tony was used
to. He had just filled the mug and tied it
down with a piece of parchment which he had
taken from the Town Records and brought with
him for the purpose, when a noise like thunder
suddenly broke on his ear. And indeed it
very nearly broke the ear itself, and so startled
Tony that the precious mug all but slipped
from his grasp. Then a wave of milk swept
up almost over his head. The whole of the
massive basin was moved sideways. Then
came a shock like an earthquake. The basin
was being set on the ground. Tony felt that
the Blue Mountain had seen him and
had screamed. What would the giant-little-girl
do? Would she kill him? If so, how?</p>

<p>These questions afforded Tony food for some
interesting reflections during the next few
moments.</p>

<p>He looked round him for a way of escape.
Everywhere towered the smooth white walls.
The tremendous spoon which he had seen the
Blue Mountain use had, unfortunately, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a><br /><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
been left in the basin, or he could have
climbed out by that. He gave himself up for
lost. Then suddenly he saw the trunk of a
slender tree appear at the edge of the basin.
It was pushed down towards him. Yes on to
the very bread-rock on which he crouched.
Would it crush him? No! The end of it
rested on the rock by his side; it gently
moved towards him. He saw now that the
Blue Mountain was not cruel. She was not
bent on destroying him. She was offering
him a way of escape. He eagerly climbed the
tree. When he was half-way up, however,
the giant-little-girl flung the tree aside, and
with Tony still clinging to it, it fell crashing
into the forest. When he came to himself he
almost shouted for joy to find the mug still
whole.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">

<div class="caption">TONY AMONG THE ROCKS IN THE BREAD-AND-MILK BASIN.</div>
</div>

<p>He never knew how he got home.</p>

<p>When he took the mug to the King the
monarch looked at it, and said—</p>

<p>“The milk’s very thick.”</p>

<p>“It’s giant cow’s milk,” said Tony, “you
drink it up and let’s see what happens.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the King, suspiciously,
“suppose it’s poison; I shall have it analysed.”</p>

<p>“Well, you promised me a reward,” said
Tony, “and you wouldn’t grudge it if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
knew what a time I’ve had of it. I might
have been killed, you know.”</p>

<p>“<i>Reward!</i>” said the King, who had been
looking at the mug, “<i>reward!</i> when you have
cracked my mug—my own only mug, with
‘A present for a good King’ on it. Reward
indeed! a stamp from the Great Seal would
be more——”</p>

<p>But Tony was gone. He ran home to tell
his grandfather—but his grandfather was not
there—only a letter lay on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>“Dear grandson,” it said, “the King has
found out that my name was entered in the
register as Anthony Antrobus, and he refuses
to believe that the alteration to Sydney Cecil
Ernest Watchett was made at my birth. So
I am seeking safety at a distance. I have
only one piece of advice to give you. <i>Do
so too.</i>—Your loving Grandfather.”</p>

<p>This seemed such good advice to Tony,
whose name was also in the register, that he
was just going to take it when the door was
flung open, and in rushed the King and the
Army. They hustled and bustled and rustled
round the house, breaking and tearing everything,
and when there was nothing more to
spoil they carried Tony off to prison.</p>

<p>“So this is my reward for getting the milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for him,” said poor Tony to himself, as he sat
in prison, loaded with chains, and waiting for
his trial. “I wish I had drunk the milk
myself. This is what comes of loyalty. But
I don’t care, my name is Tony, and his is not,
and I will say so too, if I hang for it.”</p>

<p>Acting on this resolution next day, at his
trial, Tony said so, and what is more, he came
very near indeed to hanging for it. For King
Anthony XXIII. was furious. He absolutely
danced with rage, and it took six Prime
Ministers to restrain his emotion while the
trial went on. Tony was tried for an attempt
to murder the King. The whole thing, said
the Public Persecutor, was nothing but a plot.
The prophecy of Henry Birkbeck, which
nobody had seen, till Tony found it; the
Blue Mountain, which nobody but Tony had
seen at all; the thick milk so mysteriously
obtained, all pointed to dark treason and
villainy. The crack in the mug was a
peculiarly incriminating circumstance. (I
cannot help the long words—Public Persecutors
will use them.) It was a vile plot, the
Persecutor said, but it had failed. The Public
Analyst gave evidence that the milk was not
milk at all, but some explosive substance too
dangerous to analyse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Tony looked at the Jury and he looked
round the Court, and he saw that the case
did indeed look black against himself. When
he was asked what was his defence, he
said—</p>

<p>“There is no pleasing some people.”</p>

<p>“It is my duty to caution you,” said the
Persecutor, “that everything you say will be
used against you.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it will,” said Tony, wearily,
“but I can’t help that, everything I do is used
against me too. I needn’t have told any one
anything about it. I might have got the
milk myself and been King, but I got it for
him, and I did not crack the mug. At least,
I am almost sure not. I only wish I had
drunk the milk.”</p>

<p>“Make him drink it now,” shouted a
thousand voices from the crowded Court.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” said the King, hastily, “it might
not be poison after all.”</p>

<p>“You can’t have it both ways, your
Majesty,” said the Persecutor bravely;
“either it is poison, in which case the
Prisoner deserves to drink it, or it is not
poison, in which case the Prisoner leaves the
Court without a stain upon his character.”</p>

<p>“It is poison!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t!”</p>

<p>“It is!”</p>

<p>“It is not!”</p>

<p>The shouts rose louder and louder.</p>

<p>“It is not poison, it is milk!” cried Tony,
and suddenly seizing the mug of milk, which
had been brought into the Court to give its
evidence, he lifted it to his lips, and before the
Jailer could prevent it, he drained the milk to
the last drop and ran out of the Court. For
every one was too astonished to stop him.</p>

<p>The moment he was outside, he felt a sudden
and awful change in himself. He was growing,
growing, growing. He hurried out of the
town. He felt that it would soon be too small
to hold him. Outside he got bigger and bigger
till the trees of the nearer forest were like
grass under his feet, and the mug ran out of
his hand like a little grain of rape-seed. And
there beside him stood the Mountain—a little
girl in a blue dress—and he was taller than
she was.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said the Blue Mountain, “where
did you spring from?”</p>

<p>“From the town down there,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“There?” said the Mountain, stooping,
“that’s not a town, silly, you know it’s only
an ant-heap, really.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is my town,” said Tony, “and its name
is Antioch, and——”</p>

<p>And then he told her the whole story. In
the middle of it she sat down to listen better,
crushing millions of trees as she sat. And
Tony sat down, crushing other millions, only
now it seemed to him that he had sat down on
the grass. It makes a great deal of difference
what size you are.</p>

<p>“And that is where I used to live,” said
Tony, pointing to the town, “and my name
is Tony.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” said the Blue Mountain,
“but you live next door to us, you know you
do, you always did, and that is only an
ant-heap.”</p>

<p>And when Tony looked down again it
seemed to him that perhaps it really was
only an ant-heap.</p>

<p>All the same he knew the King when he saw
him hurrying along the ramparts, and he
picked the King up and put him on a cow’s
ear. And the cow scratched its ear with its
hind foot. And that was the end of the King.</p>

<p>“Don’t tease the ants,” said the Blue
Mountain. “People pour boiling water
sometimes, or dig up the heaps, but I think
it’s cruel.”</p>

<p>“It is a nice story,” she said, “of course
the grass is like a forest to the ants, and the
big forest is the hedge. Your Sunday suit is
silk velvet, your aunt told mother so. Yes, it
is a nice story, and an ant did drop into my
bread and milk yesterday, though I don’t know
how you knew.”</p>

<p>“You mayn’t believe it;” said Tony, “but I
shall give them corn because it says so in Mr.
Birkbeck’s prophecy, only I won’t ever give
them any milk in case they grow big. They
are too bad-tempered. Just think if the King
had been our size!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come along home, do,” said the Blue
Mountain, a little crossly. “I am tired. It
is dinner time, it’s no use pretending about
Kings and things. You know well enough
you are only Tony-next-door.”</p>

<p>And whatever he may have been before, it
is quite certain that since then he has been
“Tony-next-door,” and nothing else whatever.</p>

KITCHEN-MAIDS</h2>

<div class="chaptitle"><i>THE PRINCE, TWO MICE, AND<br />
SOME KITCHEN-MAIDS</i></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the Prince was born the Queen
said to the King, “My dear, do be
very, very careful about the invitations.
You know what fairies are. They always
come to the christening whether you invite
them or not, and if you forget to invite one
of them she always makes herself so terribly
unpleasant.”</p>

<p>“My love,” said the King, “I will invite
them all,” and he took out his diamond-pointed
pen and wrote out the cards on the
spot.</p>

<p>But just then a herald came in to bring
news of war. So the King had to go off in a
hurry. The invitations were sent out, but
the christening had to be put off for a year.
At the end of this time the King had subdued
all his enemies, so he was very pleased with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
himself. The Prince was a year old, and he
also was pleased with himself, as all good
babies are, and found the little royal fingers
and toes a fresh and ever-delightful mystery.
And the Queen was pleased with herself, as
all good mothers should be—so everything
went merrily. The Palace was hung with
cloth of silver and strewn with fresh daisies,
in honour of the great day, and after all had
eaten and drunk to their hearts’ content the
fairies came near with the gifts they had
brought to their godson the Prince.</p>

<p>“He shall have beauty,” said the first.</p>

<p>“And wit,” said the second.</p>

<p>“And a pretty sweetheart,” said the third;
“who loves him,” said the fourth.</p>

<p>And so they went on, foretelling for him all
sorts of happy and desirable things. And as
each fairy gave her gift she stooped and kissed
the baby Prince, and then spreading her fine
gossamer-gauze wings, fluttered away across
the rosy garden. The crowd of fairies grew
less and less, and there were only three left
when the Queen pulled the King’s sleeve and
whispered, “My dear, where’s Malevola?”</p>

<p>“I sent her a card,” said the King, casting
an anxious look round him.</p>

<p>“Then it must have been lost on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
way,” said the Queen, “or she’d have been
here——”</p>

<p>“She <i>is</i> here,” said a low voice in the
Queen’s ear. Suddenly the room grew dark,
grey clouds hid the sun, and all the daisies on
the floor shut up quite close. The poor Queen
gave a start and a scream, and the King, brave
as he was, turned pale, for Malevola was a
terrible fairy, and the dress she wore was not
at all the thing for a christening. It was
made of spiders’ webs matted together, dark
and dank with the damp of the tomb and the
dust of dungeons. Her wings were the wings
of a great bat; spiders and newts crawled
round her neck; a serpent coiled about her
waist and little snakes twisted and writhed in
her straight black hair.</p>

<p>She looked at the Queen so terribly that
her poor Mother-Majesty cried out without
meaning to.</p>

<p>“Oh don’t!” she cried, and flung both
arms round the cradle. The Prince was
quite happy, playing with his new coral and
bells, and looking at the Palace cat, who sat
at the foot of the cradle washing herself.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” said Malevola, still speaking
in the low, even voice that was so terrible.
“You did not invite me to the christening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
I’ve read my fairy tales, and I know what’s
expected of a fairy who is left out on an
occasion like this. I intend to curse your
son.”</p>

<p>Then all the Kings and Queens who had
come to the christening wished they had
stayed away, and they and all the Court fell
on their knees and begged Malevola for mercy.
As for the three good fairies who were left,
they hid behind the window-curtains, and the
Court ladies, peeping between their fingers,
said—</p>

<p>“Fancy deserting their godson like this!
How unfairy-like!”</p>

<p>But the Queen and the King only wept,
and the Prince played with his rattle and
looked at the cat.</p>

<p>Then Malevola said mockingly: “Great
King and mighty Sovereign, Malevola was
not good enough to be asked to your tea-party.
But your family shall come down in
the world; your son shall marry a kitchen-maid
and marry a lady with four feet and no
hands.”</p>

<p>A shiver of horror ran through the room,
and Malevola vanished. Then, suddenly, the
sun came out, and people lifted up their
heads, and dared again to look at each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a><br /><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a><br /><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
And the daisies, too, opened their eyes
again.</p>

<div class="caption">MALEVOLA’S DRESS WAS NOT AT ALL THE THING FOR A CHRISTENING.</div>
</div>

<p>Then the good fairies came out from behind
the window-curtains, and the poor Queen fell
on her knees before them.</p>

<p>“Can’t you do <i>anything?</i>” she asked.
“Can’t you undo what she says, and make
it untrue?”</p>

<p>“Not even a fairy can make a true thing
untrue,” said the good fairies sadly. “Malevola’s
words will come true; but the Prince
has already many gifts, and our gifts are yet
to give, and these you shall choose. Whatever
you wish shall be his.”</p>

<p>Then the King, recovering a little from the
terror into which the fairy Malevola had
thrown him, and remembering how well he
and his royal line had always borne them in
battle, said at once—</p>

<p>“Let the boy be brave.”</p>

<p>“He is brave,” said one of the good fairies;
“he fears nothing.”</p>

<p>And at this the Prince ceased to feel any
fear of the Palace cat. He put out his hand
and pulled her tail so merrily that Pussy
turned and clawed the little arm till the
blood ran.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried his mother, “he is fearless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
as you say. I wish he were afraid of cats,
poor darling.”</p>

<p>“He is,” said the second fairy; “you
have your wish.” And, indeed, the Prince
screamed, and hid his face, and shrank from
the Palace cat with such horror that the King
pulled out his pencil and note-book and wrote
an edict then and there banishing all cats
from his dominions. But, all the same, he
was very angry.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty has wasted one wish,” he
said very politely to the Queen; “let us now
leave the last gift in the hands of the last
fairy.”</p>

<p>The last fairy came and kissed the Prince,
who was now sobbing sleepily.</p>

<p>“He shall be happy,” she said; “he shall
have his heart’s desire.”</p>

<p>Then she too vanished; and the Kings and
Queens took their leave when their gold
coaches came for them. And presently the
King and Queen were left alone with the
silver hangings and the strewn daisies and
the baby.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! oh dear!” said the Queen;
“this is dreadful! A kitchen-maid!—and a
lady with four feet and no hands!”</p>

<p>“At least we are not likely to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
kitchen-maid with less than two hands,” said
the King.</p>

<p>“We might arrange only to have <i>titled</i>
kitchen-maids,” said the Queen timidly.</p>

<p>“The very thing,” the King answered:
“that would make the love affair all that one
could wish. But there’s still the marriage.”</p>

<p>“Of course he’ll marry the lady he loves.”</p>

<p>“It’s not the way of the world,” said the
King. “At any rate, let’s hope he’ll love
the lady he marries. Otherwise——”</p>

<p>“Otherwise what?” said the Queen.</p>

<p>“We know nothing about otherwise, do we,
my Queen?” he said, catching her round the
waist. And in his love for his wife and his
son the King felt almost happy again, for
here they were all three together, and when
your son is in his cradle his marriage seems
very far off indeed.</p>

<p>But the Queen was anxious and frightened,
and while the Prince was still a child she sent
messengers to the Courts of all the neighbouring
Kings and Queens to tell them what had
been foretold, which, indeed, most of them
knew, having been at the christening. And
she begged such of them as had daughters to
send them as kitchen-maids, that so the
Prince might at least fall in love with a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Princess. And as the Prince grew up he was
so handsome and so brave, fearing nothing
but cats, which, of course, he never saw,
though he dreamed of them often and
woke screaming, and also so brilliant and
good, that, his father’s kingdom, being beyond
compare the finest in all the round world, the
young daughters of Kings vied with each
other as to who should find favour in the eyes
of the Queen-Mother, and so get leave to
serve in the kitchen, each nursing the hope
that some day the Prince would see her and
love her, and perhaps even marry her. And
he was very good friends with all the noble
kitchen-maids, but he loved none of them,
till one day he saw, at a window of the
tower where the kitchen was, a bright face
and bright hair tied round with a scarlet
kerchief. And as he looked at the face it was
withdrawn—but the Prince had lost his heart.
He kept his secret safe in the place where his
heart had been, and schemed and plotted to
see this fair lady again; for when he went
among the royal kitchen-maids she was not
there with them. And he looked morning,
noon, and evening, but he never could see
her. So then he said—</p>

<p>“I must watch o’ nights—perhaps she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
kept in prison in the tower above the kitchen,
and at night those who watch her may sleep,
and so I shall be able to talk to her.”</p>

<p>So he dressed in dark clothes and hid in the
shadow of the palace courtyard and watched
all one night. And he saw nothing. But in
the early morning, when the setting moon and
the rising sun were mixing their lights in the
sky, he heard a heavy bolt shot back, and the
door of the kitchen tower opened slowly. The
Prince crouched behind a buttress and watched,
and he saw the fair maid with the bright hair
under the red kerchief. She swept the doorstep,
and she drew water from the well in the
middle of the courtyard; and presently he crept
to the kitchen window and saw her light the
fire and wash the dishes, and make all neat and
clean within. And the Prince’s eyes followed
her in all she did, and the more he looked at
her the more he loved her. And at last he
heard sounds as of folks stirring above, so he
crept away, keeping close to the wall, and so
back to his own rooms. And this he did again
on the next morning, and on the next. And
on the third morning, as he stood looking
through the window at the girl with the bright
hair and the bright kerchief, the gold chain he
wore clinked against the stone of the window-sill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The maid started, and the bowl she held
dropped on to the brick floor of the kitchen
and broke into twenty pieces; and then and
there she sat down on the floor beside it, and
began to cry bitterly.</p>

<p>The Prince ran in and knelt beside her.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, dear,” he said, “I’ll get you
another bowl.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” she sobbed, “but now they’ll
send me away.”</p>

<p>“Who will?”</p>

<p>“The noble Kitchen-Maids. They keep me
to do the work because, being Kings’ daughters,
they don’t know how to do anything; but the
Queen doesn’t know that there is a Real
Kitchen-maid here, and now you have found
out they will send me away.”</p>

<p>And she went on crying.</p>

<p>“Then you are a Real Kitchen-maid, and
not noble at all?” said the Prince.</p>

<p>She stopped crying for a minute to say
“No.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the Prince. “You are
twice as pretty as all the Kings’ daughters put
together and twenty times as dear.”</p>

<p>At that she stopped crying for good and all,
and looked up at him from the floor where she
sat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes you are,” he said, “and I love you
with all my heart.”</p>

<p>And with that he caught her in his arms and
kissed her; and the Real Kitchen-Maid laid
her face against his, and her heart beat wildly,
for she knew what the Prince did not, and
what, indeed, all the folk knew except the
Prince, that this had been foretold at his
christening; but she knew also that though he
loved her, he was not to marry her, since it was
his dreadful destiny to marry some one with
four feet and no hands.</p>

<p>“I wish I had no hands and four feet,” said
the Real Kitchen-maid to herself. “I wouldn’t
mind a bit, since it is me he loves.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying?” asked the
Prince.</p>

<p>“I am saying that you must go,” said she.
“If their Kitchen Highnesses find you here
with me they’ll tear me into little pieces, for
they all love you—to a Highness.”</p>

<p>“And you,” he whispered, “how much do
you love me?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she answered, “I love you better than
my right hand and my left.”</p>

<p>And the Prince thought that a very strange
answer. He went through that day in a happy
dream; but he did not tell his dream to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
one, lest some harm should come to the Real
Kitchen-Maid. For he meant to marry her,
and he had a feeling that his parents would
not approve of the match.</p>

<p>Now that night, when the whole palace was
asleep, the Real Kitchen-Maid got up and
crept out past the sleepy sentinel and went
home to her father the farmer and got one of
his great white cart horses and rode away
through the woods to the cavern where the
Great White Rat sits sleeplessly guarding the
Magic Cat’s-eye.</p>

<p>And every one wondered why he guarded it
so carefully, for it seemed to have no great
value. But the Great White Rat watched it
constantly, without ever closing one of those
round bright rat’-eyes of his, and when folk
sought to lay hands on it he said—</p>

<p>“Be careful: it has the power to change you
into a mouse.”</p>

<p>On which folk dropped it hastily and went
their ways, leaving him still on guard.</p>

<p>To him now went the little Kitchen-Maid,
and asked for help, for he was thousands of
years old, and had more wisdom between his
nose and ears than all the books in all the
world. She told him all that had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now what shall I do?” she said. And the
Great White Rat, never shifting his eyes from
the Magic Cat’s-eye, answered—</p>

<p>“Keep your own counsel and be contented.
The Prince loves you.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Real Kitchen-Maid, “he is
not to marry me, but a horrible creature with
four feet and no hands.”</p>

<p>“Keep your secret and be content,” the
Great White Rat repeated, “and if ever you
see him in danger from a lady with four feet
and no hands, come straight to me.”</p>

<p>So the Real Kitchen-Maid went back to the
Palace, and set to work to clean pots and pans,
for now it was bright dewy daylight, and the
night had gone. And before the rest were
awake again her Prince came to her and vowed
he loved her more than life; so she kept her
secret and was content.</p>

<p>At the time of the Prince’s christening the
King had banished all cats from the kingdom,
because he could not bear to see his son show
fear of anything. But now and then strangers,
not knowing of the edict, brought cats to that
country, and if the Prince saw one of these
cats he was taken with a trembling and a
paleness, standing like stone awhile, and
presently, with shrieks of terror, fleeing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
spot. And it was now a long time since he had
seen a cat.</p>

<p>Now, soon after the Prince had found out
how he loved the Real Kitchen-Maid, his
father and mother died suddenly as they
were sitting hand in hand, for they loved each
other so much that it was not possible for
either to stay here without the other.</p>

<p>So then the Prince wept bitterly, and would
not be comforted, and the Court stood about
him with a long face, wearing its new mourning.
And as he sat there with his face hidden
Something came through the Palace gate and
up the marble stairs and into the great hall
where the Prince sat on the steps of his father’s
throne weeping. And, before the courtiers
could draw breath or decide whether it was
Court etiquette for them to do anything while
the Prince was crying except to stand still and
look sad, the creature came up to the Prince
and began to rub itself against his arm. And
he, still hiding his face, reached out his hand
and stroked it!</p>

<p>Then all the Court drew a deep breath, for
they saw that the thing that had come in was
a great black Cat.</p>

<p>And the Prince raised his eyes, and they
looked to see him shrink and shriek; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
instead he passed his hand over the black fur
and said—</p>

<p>“Poor Pussy, then!”</p>

<p>And at these words the whole Court fled—by
window and door. The courtiers took
horse, those who had carriages went away in
them, those who had none went on foot, and in
less than a minute the Prince and the Cat were
left alone together.</p>

<p>For the Court was learned in witch law, and
knowing the Prince’s horror of cats it saw at
once that a cat he was not afraid of was no
cat at all, but a witch in that shape. Therefore
the courtiers and the whole Royal household
fled trembling and hid themselves.</p>

<p>All but the little Real Kitchen-Maid. She
saw with terror that the Cat, or rather the
witch in Cat’s shape, had done what no one
else could do—roused the Prince from his dull
dream of grief. And then she remembered the
fate which Malevola had foretold for him—that
he should marry a lady with four feet
and no hands.</p>

<p>“Alack-a-day!” she cried. “This witch
has four feet and no hands; but she can have
hands whenever she chooses, and be a woman
by her magic arts as easily as she can be a cat.
And then he will love her—and what will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
become of me? Or, worse, she may marry
him only to torment him. She may shut him
up in some enchanted dungeon far from the
light of day. Such things have happened
before now.”</p>

<p>So she stood, hidden by the blue arras, and
wrung her hands, and the tears ran down her
cheeks. And all the time the black Cat purred
to the Prince, and the Prince stroked the black
Cat, and any one could have seen that he was
every moment becoming more deeply bewitched.
And still the Real Kitchen-Maid
crouched behind the arras, and her heart ached
that it knew no way to save him. Then suddenly
she remembered the words of the Great
White Rat—</p>

<p>“If ever you see him in danger from a lady
with four feet and no hands come straight to
me.”</p>

<p>Now surely was the time, for the Prince, she
knew, was in desperate danger.</p>

<p>The Real Kitchen-Maid crept silently down
the marble stairs, but once she was out of the
Palace she ran like the wind to the stable. No
men were about there—all had followed the
example of the Court, and had run away when
they heard of the strange coming of the
witch-Cat. And of all the many horses that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had stood in the stable only one remained, for
each man in his fright had saddled the first
horse that came to hand and ridden off on it.
And the one that still stayed there was the
Prince’s own black charger. He had had no
mind to be saddled in haste by a stranger, and
had turned and bitten the stranger who had
attempted it. So he was there alone.</p>

<p>Now the little Kitchen-Maid lifted the
Prince’s gold-broidered saddle from its perch,
and the weight of it was such that she could
not have carried it but for the heavy heart she
bore because of her love to the Prince and his
danger, and that made all else seem light.
She put the saddle on the charger, and the
jewelled bridle. And he neighed with pleasure,
for he understood, being a horse who could
see as far into a stone wall as most people.
And when he was saddled he knelt for her to
mount, and then up and away like the wind,
and she had no need to guide him with the
reins, for he found the way and kept it. He
galloped steadily on, and the sun went down
and the night grew dark, and he went on, and
on, and on without stumble or pause, till at
moonrise he halted before the house of the
Great White Rat.</p>

<p>Then, as the Real Kitchen-Maid sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
down, the Great White Rat came out from his
house and spoke. “You’ve come for it,
then?”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“The Magic Cat’s-eye. I’ve guarded it
some thousands of years. I knew there would
be a use for it at last. He may be saved yet,
if some one should love him well enough to
die for him.”</p>

<p>“I do that,” said the little Kitchen-Maid,
and took the Cat’s-eye in her hands.</p>

<p>“Swallow it,” said the White Rat, “and
you’ll turn into a mouse.”</p>

<p>The little maid swallowed it at once, and,
behold! she was a little mouse.</p>

<p>“What am I to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you,” said the Great White
Rat, “but Love will tell you.”</p>

<p>So the little Kitchen-Maid, in the form of
the mouse, ran up one of the horse’s legs,
and held tight on to the saddle with all her
little claws.</p>

<p>And as the great horse galloped back
towards the palace in the moonlight, she
thought and thought, and at last she said
to herself—</p>

<p>“The witch is in cat’s shape, and she must
have cat nature, so she will run after a mouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
She will run after <i>me</i>, and if I can lead her to
a running stream she will leap across it, and
then she will have to take her own shape
again. That must be what the Great White
Rat meant me to do. And if the Cat catches
me—well, at least if I can’t save my Prince I
can die for him.”</p>

<p>And the thought warmed her heart as the
great horse thundered on through the dawn-light.</p>

<p>When at last, creeping softly on little noiseless
feet, the Mouse-Kitchen-Maid re-entered
the great hall, she saw that she was only just
in time, for the black Cat was purring and
looking back at the Prince as she walked,
waving her black tail towards the further door
of the hall, and the Prince, more bewitched
than ever, was slowly following her.</p>

<p>Then the Real-Kitchen-Maid-Mouse uttered
a squeak, and rushed across the porphyry floor,
and the black Cat, true to its cat nature, left
purring at the Prince and sprang after the
Mouse, and the Mouse at its best speed, made
for the garden where ran the stream that fed
the marble basins where the royal gold-fish
lived. The Prince understood nothing save
that the enchanting black furry creature was
leaving him, and in an instant he was alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
He followed to the door, and saw the Cat
springing along the passage down the stairs—he
followed fast—then along another passage
that passed the foot of the back stairs, and he
saw that the back stairs were like a water-fall—water
was running down in a torrent and
meandering away down the brick passage and
out into the faint new sunshine.</p>

<p>When the Mouse saw this stream, she
thought, “I’m saved.” She never thought of
wondering how a stream came to be running
down the back stairs of the palace. When she
came to think of it afterwards she always
believed that the Great White Rat had
managed it somehow. She never knew that
it was really a great flood from the royal bathroom,
where the royal housemaid, in her
eagerness to run away from the witch, had left
all the royal bath-taps full on.</p>

<p>The Mouse bounded across the stream—the
Cat saw the danger, but she could not stop
herself. She, too, crossed the stream, and as
she crossed it she turned into the wicked fairy
Malevola—cobwebs, and snakes, and newts,
and bat’s-wings, and all.</p>

<p>The Prince put his hand to his head like one
awakening from sleep, and the horrible fairy
vanished suddenly and for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Mouse ran trembling to the
Prince, and in its thin little mouse’s voice
told him all.</p>

<p>“My love and my lady,” he said, holding
the Mouse against his cheek. “I will marry
you now. That will carry out the wicked
fairy’s prophecy. Then we will go back to the
Great White Rat, and you shall be changed
into a Princess.”</p>

<p>So the Prince rang the church bells till all
the people came out of their holes where they
had been hiding, to see the strange spectacle of
a Prince married to a Mouse.</p>

<p>And directly they were married they set off
on the black charger, and when they reached
the Great White Rat they told their tale.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the Prince joyously, “if
you will change her into a lady again we will
go home at once and begin living happily
ever after.”</p>

<p>The Great White Rat looked at them
gravely.</p>

<p>“It’s impossible,” he said. “I am sorry,
but the effects of the Magic Cat’s-eye are
<i>permanent</i>. Once a mouse, always a mouse,
if you get moused by the Magic Cat’s-eye.”</p>

<p>The Prince and the Mouse looked sadly at
each other. This was the last thing they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
expected. The Great White Rat looked at
them earnestly. Then he said—</p>

<p>“If it would be of any use to you, I’ve got
another Magic Cat’s-eye.”</p>

<p>He held it out. The Prince took it gladly.
Kingdom and the life of a king were nothing
to him compared with the love and happiness
of a Real-Kitchen-Maid disguised as a mouse.
He put the stone to his lips.</p>

<p>“You know what’ll happen if you do,” said
the Great White Rat.</p>

<p>“I shall change into a mouse and live happy
ever after,” said the Prince gaily.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the Great White Rat,
“nothing is impossible if people love each
other enough.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t,” cried the Mouse, trying to
get between his lips and the Cat’s-eye.</p>

<div class="caption">THERE STOOD UP A PRINCE AND A PRINCESS.</div>
</div>

<p>“My dear little Real Kitchen-Maid,” said
the Prince tenderly, “you have saved my life—and
you <i>are</i> my life. I would rather be a
mouse with you than a king without you!”
And with that he swallowed the Cat’s-eye, and
two small mice stood side by side before the
Great White Rat. Very kindly he looked at
them. Then he pulled a hair from his left
whisker and laid it across their little brown
backs. And on the instant there stood up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a><br /><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a><br /><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Prince and a Princess and at their feet lay
the little empty mouse-skins.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky for you,” said the Great White
Rat, “that you chose to swallow the Cat’s-eye,
because people who have been moused by that
means can never be un-moused except <i>in pairs</i>.
Nothing is impossible if people only love each
other enough.”</p>

<p>So the Prince and his bride returned to the
palace and lived happy ever after. They were
as happy as if they had been mice—which,
in a country where there are no cats, is
saying a good deal. Of course the Prince is
still afraid of cats. But the curious thing is
that now his wife is afraid of them too. Perhaps
she learnt that lesson when she was a
mouse for his sake. He, when he was a mouse
for hers, learned this lesson, which is also the
moral of this story: “Nothing is impossible if
people only love each other enough.”</p>

<div class="chaptitle"><i>MELISANDE</i><br />

<i><small>OR, LONG AND SHORT DIVISION</small></i></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the Princess Melisande was born,
her mother, the Queen, wished to have
a christening party, but the King put his foot
down and said he would not have it.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen too much trouble come of christening
parties,” said he. “However carefully
you keep your visiting-book, some fairy or
other is sure to get left out, and you know
what <i>that</i> leads to. Why, even in my own
family, the most shocking things have occurred.
The Fairy Malevola was not asked to my great-grandmother’s
christening—and you know all
about the spindle and the hundred years’
sleep.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” said the Queen.
“My own cousin by marriage forgot some
stuffy old fairy or other when she was sending
out the cards for her daughter’s christening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and the old wretch turned up at the last
moment, and the girl drops toads out of her
mouth to this day.”</p>

<p>“Just so. And then there was that business
of the mouse and the kitchen-maids,” said the
King; “we’ll have no nonsense about it. I’ll
be her godfather, and you shall be her godmother,
and we won’t ask a single fairy; then
none of them can be offended.”</p>

<p>“Unless they all are,” said the Queen.</p>

<p>And that was exactly what happened. When
the King and the Queen and the baby got
back from the christening the parlourmaid
met them at the door, and said—</p>

<p>“Please, your Majesty, several ladies have
called. I told them you were not at home,
but they all said they’d wait.”</p>

<p>“Are they in the parlour?” asked the
Queen.</p>

<p>“I’ve shown them into the Throne Room,
your Majesty,” said the parlourmaid. “You
see, there are several of them.”</p>

<p>There were about seven hundred. The
great Throne Room was crammed with fairies,
of all ages and of all degrees of beauty and
ugliness—good fairies and bad fairies, flower
fairies and moon fairies, fairies like spiders
and fairies like butterflies—and as the Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
opened the door and began to say how sorry
she was to have kept them waiting, they all
cried, with one voice, “Why didn’t you ask
<i>me</i> to your christening party?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had a party,” said the Queen,
and she turned to the King and whispered,
“I told you so.” This was her only consolation.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a christening,” said the fairies,
all together.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” said the poor Queen, but
Malevola pushed forward and said, “Hold
your tongue,” most rudely.</p>

<p>Malevola is the oldest, as well as the most
wicked, of the fairies. She is deservedly
unpopular, and has been left out of more
christening parties than all the rest of the
fairies put together.</p>

<p>“Don’t begin to make excuses,” she said,
shaking her finger at the Queen. “That only
makes your conduct worse. You know well
enough what happens if a fairy is left out of a
christening party. We are all going to give
our christening presents <i>now</i>. As the fairy of
highest social position, I shall begin. The
Princess shall be bald.”</p>

<p>The Queen nearly fainted as Malevola drew
back, and another fairy, in a smart bonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
with snakes in it, stepped forward with a
rustle of bats’ wings. But the King stepped
forward too.</p>

<p>“No you don’t!” said he. “I wonder at
you, ladies, I do indeed. How can you be so
unfairylike? Have none of you been to school—have
none of you studied the history of your
own race? Surely you don’t need a poor,
ignorant King like me to tell you that this
is <i>no go?</i>”</p>

<p>“How dare you?” cried the fairy in the
bonnet, and the snakes in it quivered as she
tossed her head. “It is my turn, and I say
the Princess shall be——”</p>

<p>The King actually put his hand over her
mouth.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said; “I won’t have it.
Listen to reason—or you’ll be sorry afterwards.
A fairy who breaks the traditions of fairy
history goes out—you know she does—like
the flame of a candle. And all tradition
shows that only <i>one</i> bad fairy is ever forgotten
at a christening party and the good ones are
always invited; so either this is not a christening
party, or else you were all invited
except one, and, by her own showing, that
was Malevola. It nearly always is. Do I
make myself clear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of the better-class fairies who had
been led away by Malevola’s influence murmured
that there was something in what His
Majesty said.</p>

<p>“Try it, if you don’t believe me,” said the
King; “give your nasty gifts to my innocent
child—but as sure as you do, out you go, like
a candle-flame. Now, then, will you risk it?”</p>

<p>No one answered, and presently several
fairies came up to the Queen and said what
a pleasant party it had been, but they really
must be going. This example decided the
rest. One by one all the fairies said goodbye
and thanked the Queen for the delightful
afternoon they had spent with her.</p>

<p>“It’s been quite too lovely,” said the lady
with the snake-bonnet; “<i>do</i> ask us again
soon, dear Queen. I shall be so <i>longing</i> to
see you again, and the <i>dear</i> baby,” and off she
went, with the snake-trimming quivering more
than ever.</p>

<p>When the very last fairy was gone the
Queen ran to look at the baby—she tore off
its Honiton lace cap and burst into tears.
For all the baby’s downy golden hair came off
with the cap, and the Princess Melisande was
as bald as an egg.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, my love,” said the King. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
have a wish lying by, which I’ve never had
occasion to use. My fairy godmother gave it
me for a wedding present, but since then I’ve
had nothing to wish for!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear,” said the Queen, smiling
through her tears.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep the wish till baby grows up,” the
King went on. “And then I’ll give it to her,
and if she likes to wish for hair she can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t you wish for it <i>now?</i>” said the
Queen, dropping mixed tears and kisses on
the baby’s round, smooth head.</p>

<p>“No, dearest. She may want something
else more when she grows up. And besides,
her hair may grow by itself.”</p>

<p>But it never did. Princess Melisande grew
up as beautiful as the sun and as good as
gold, but never a hair grew on that little head
of hers. The Queen sewed her little caps of
green silk, and the Princess’s pink and white
face looked out of these like a flower peeping
out of its bud. And every day as she grew
older she grew dearer, and as she grew dearer
she grew better, and as she grew more good
she grew more beautiful.</p>

<p>Now, when she was grown up the Queen
said to the King—</p>

<p>“My love, our dear daughter is old enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to know what she wants. Let her have the
wish.”</p>

<p>So the King wrote to his fairy godmother
and sent the letter by a butterfly. He asked
if he might hand on to his daughter the
wish the fairy had given him for a wedding
present.</p>

<p>“I have never had occasion to use it,” said
he, “though it has always made me happy to
remember that I had such a thing in the
house. The wish is as good as new, and my
daughter is now of an age to appreciate so
valuable a present.”</p>

<p>To which the fairy replied by return of
butterfly:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear King</span>,—Pray do whatever you like
with my poor little present. I had quite
forgotten it, but I am pleased to think that
you have treasured my humble keepsake all
these years.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">“Your affectionate godmother,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Fortuna F.</span>”<br />
</div></div>

<p>So the King unlocked his gold safe with the
seven diamond-handled keys that hung at his
girdle, and took out the wish and gave it to
his daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>And Melisande said: “Father, I will wish
that all your subjects should be quite happy.”</p>

<p>But they were that already, because the
King and Queen were so good. So the wish
did not go off.</p>

<p>So then she said: “Then I wish them all
to be good.”</p>

<p>But they were that already, because they
were happy. So again the wish hung fire.</p>

<p>Then the Queen said: “Dearest, for my
sake, wish what I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I will,” said Melisande.
The Queen whispered in her ear, and Melisande
nodded. Then she said, aloud—</p>

<p>“I wish I had golden hair a yard long,
and that it would grow an inch every day,
and grow twice as fast every time it was cut,
and——”</p>

<p>“Stop,” cried the King. And the wish
went off, and the next moment the Princess
stood smiling at him through a shower of
golden hair.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely,” said the Queen. “What
a pity you interrupted her, dear; she hadn’t
finished.”</p>

<p>“What was the end?” asked the King.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Melisande, “I was only going
to say, ‘and twice as thick.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a very good thing you didn’t,” said
the King. “You’ve done about enough.” For
he had a mathematical mind, and could do
the sums about the grains of wheat on the
chess-board, and the nails in the horse’s
shoes, in his Royal head without any trouble
at all.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked the
Queen.</p>

<p>“You’ll know soon enough,” said the King.
“Come, let’s be happy while we may. Give
me a kiss, little Melisande, and then go to
nurse and ask her to teach you how to comb
your hair.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Melisande, “I’ve often
combed mother’s.”</p>

<p>“Your mother has beautiful hair,” said the
King; “but I fancy you will find your own
less easy to manage.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was so. The Princess’s hair
began by being a yard long, and it grew an
inch every night. If you know anything at
all about the simplest sums you will see that
in about five weeks her hair was about two
yards long. This is a very inconvenient
length. It trails on the floor and sweeps up
all the dust, and though in palaces, of course,
it is all gold-dust, still it is not nice to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
it in your hair. And the Princess’s hair was
growing an inch every night. When it was
three yards long the Princess could not bear it
any longer—it was so heavy and so hot—so
she borrowed nurse’s cutting-out scissors and
cut it all off, and then for a few hours she was
comfortable. But the hair went on growing,
and now it grew twice as fast as before; so
that in thirty-six days it was as long as ever.
The poor Princess cried with tiredness; when
she couldn’t bear it any more she cut her hair
and was comfortable for a very little time.
For the hair now grew four times as fast as at
first, and in eighteen days it was as long as
before, and she had to have it cut. Then it
grew eight inches a day, and the next time it
was cut it grew sixteen inches a day, and then
thirty-two inches and sixty-four inches and a
hundred and twenty-eight inches a day, and
so on, growing twice as fast after each cutting,
till the Princess would go to bed at night with
her hair clipped short, and wake up in the
morning with yards and yards and yards of
golden hair flowing all about the room, so that
she could not move without pulling her own
hair, and nurse had to come and cut the hair
off before she could get out of bed.</p>

<p>“I wish I was bald again,” sighed poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Melisande, looking at the little green caps she
used to wear, and she cried herself to sleep
o’ nights between the golden billows of the
golden hair. But she never let her mother
see her cry, because it was the Queen’s fault,
and Melisande did not want to seem to
reproach her.</p>

<p>When first the Princess’s hair grew her
mother sent locks of it to all her Royal relations,
who had them set in rings and brooches.
Later, the Queen was able to send enough for
bracelets and girdles. But presently so much
hair was cut off that they had to burn it.
Then when autumn came all the crops failed;
it seemed as though all the gold of harvest
had gone into the Princess’s hair. And there
was a famine. Then Melisande said—</p>

<p>“It seems a pity to waste all my hair; it
does grow so very fast. Couldn’t we stuff
things with it, or something, and sell them,
to feed the people?”</p>

<p>So the King called a council of merchants,
and they sent out samples of the Princess’s
hair, and soon orders came pouring in; and
the Princess’s hair became the staple export
of that country. They stuffed pillows with it,
and they stuffed beds with it. They made
ropes of it for sailors to use, and curtains for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
hanging in Kings’ palaces. They made haircloth
of it, for hermits, and other people who
wished to be uncomfy. But it was so soft
and silky that it only made them happy and
warm, which they did not wish to be. So
the hermits gave up wearing it, and, instead,
mothers bought it for their little babies, and
all well-born infants wore little shirts of
Princess-haircloth.</p>

<p>And still the hair grew and grew. And the
people were fed and the famine came to an
end.</p>

<p>Then the King said: “It was all very well
while the famine lasted—but now I shall
write to my fairy godmother and see if something
cannot be done.”</p>

<p>So he wrote and sent the letter by a skylark,
and by return of bird came this answer—</p>

<p>“Why not advertise for a competent Prince?
Offer the usual reward.”</p>

<p>So the King sent out his heralds all over
the world to proclaim that any respectable
Prince with proper references should marry
the Princess Melisande if he could stop her
hair growing.</p>

<p>Then from far and near came trains of
Princes anxious to try their luck, and they
brought all sorts of nasty things with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a><br /><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a><br /><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in bottles and round wooden boxes. The
Princess tried all the remedies, but she did
not like any of them, and she did not like
any of the Princes, so in her heart she was
rather glad that none of the nasty things in
bottles and boxes made the least difference
to her hair.</p>

<div class="caption">TRAINS OF PRINCES BRINGING NASTY THINGS IN BOTTLES AND ROUND WOODEN BOXES.</div>
</div>

<p>The Princess had to sleep in the great
Throne Room now, because no other room
was big enough to hold her and her hair.
When she woke in the morning the long
high room would be quite full of her golden
hair, packed tight and thick like wool in a
barn. And every night when she had had
the hair cut close to her head she would sit
in her green silk gown by the window and cry,
and kiss the little green caps she used to wear,
and wish herself bald again.</p>

<p>It was as she sat crying there on Midsummer
Eve that she first saw Prince Florizel.</p>

<p>He had come to the palace that evening,
but he would not appear in her presence with
the dust of travel on him, and she had retired
with her hair borne by twenty pages before he
had bathed and changed his garments and
entered the reception-room.</p>

<p>Now he was walking in the garden in the
moonlight, and he looked up and she looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
down, and for the first time Melisande, looking
on a Prince, wished that he might have the
power to stop her hair from growing. As for
the Prince, he wished many things, and the
first was granted him. For he said—</p>

<p>“You are Melisande?”</p>

<p>“And you are Florizel?”</p>

<p>“There are many roses round your window,”
said he to her, “and none down here.”</p>

<p>She threw him one of three white roses she
held in her hand. Then he said—</p>

<p>“White rose trees are strong. May I climb
up to you?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the Princess.</p>

<p>So he climbed up to the window.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “if I can do what your
father asks, will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“My father has promised that I shall,” said
Melisande, playing with the white roses in
her hand.</p>

<p>“Dear Princess,” said he, “your father’s
promise is nothing to me. I want yours.
Will you give it to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, and gave him the second
rose.</p>

<p>“I want your hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>“And your heart with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Princess, and she gave him
the third rose.</p>

<p>“And a kiss to seal the promise.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she.</p>

<p>“And a kiss to go with the hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>“And a kiss to bring the heart.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Princess, and she gave him
the three kisses.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, when he had given them
back to her, “to-night do not go to bed.
Stay by your window, and I will stay
down here in the garden and watch. And
when your hair has grown to the filling of
your room call to me, and then do as I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the Princess.</p>

<p>So at dewy sunrise the Prince, lying on the
turf beside the sun-dial, heard her voice—</p>

<p>“Florizel! Florizel! My hair has grown
so long that it is pushing me out of the
window.”</p>

<p>“Get out on to the window-sill,” said he,
“and twist your hair three times round the
great iron hook that is there.”</p>

<p>And she did.</p>

<p>Then the Prince climbed up the rose bush
with his naked sword in his teeth, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
took the Princess’s hair in his hand about a
yard from her head and said—</p>

<p>“Jump!”</p>

<p>The Princess jumped, and screamed, for
there she was hanging from the hook by a
yard and a half of her bright hair; the Prince
tightened his grasp of the hair and drew his
sword across it.</p>

<p>Then he let her down gently by her hair till
her feet were on the grass, and jumped down
after her.</p>

<p>They stayed talking in the garden till all
the shadows had crept under their proper trees
and the sun-dial said it was breakfast time.</p>

<p>Then they went in to breakfast, and all the
Court crowded round to wonder and admire.
For the Princess’s hair had not grown.</p>

<p>“How did you do it?” asked the King,
shaking Florizel warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>“The simplest thing in the world,” said
Florizel, modestly. “You have always cut
the hair off the Princess. <i>I</i> just cut the
Princess off the hair.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the King, who had a
logical mind. And during breakfast he more
than once looked anxiously at his daughter.
When they got up from breakfast the Princess
rose with the rest, but she rose and rose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
rose, till it seemed as though there would
never be an end of it. The Princess was nine
feet high.</p>

<p>“I feared as much,” said the King, sadly.
“I wonder what will be the rate of progression.
You see,” he said to poor Florizel,
“when we cut the hair off <i>it</i> grows—when
we cut the Princess off <i>she</i> grows. I wish
you had happened to think of that!”</p>

<p>The Princess went on growing. By dinner-time
she was so large that she had to have
her dinner brought out into the garden
because she was too large to get indoors.
But she was too unhappy to be able to eat
anything. And she cried so much that there
was quite a pool in the garden, and several
pages were nearly drowned. So she remembered
her “Alice in Wonderland,” and
stopped crying at once. But she did not
stop growing. She grew bigger and bigger
and bigger, till she had to go outside the
palace gardens and sit on the common, and
even that was too small to hold her comfortably,
for every hour she grew twice as much
as she had done the hour before. And nobody
knew what to do, nor where the Princess was
to sleep. Fortunately, her clothes had grown
with her, or she would have been very cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
indeed, and now she sat on the common in
her green gown, embroidered with gold,
looking like a great hill covered with gorse
in flower.</p>

<p>You cannot possibly imagine how large the
Princess was growing, and her mother stood
wringing her hands on the castle tower, and
the Prince Florizel looked on broken-hearted
to see his Princess snatched from his arms
and turned into a lady as big as a mountain.</p>

<p>The King did not weep or look on. He sat
down at once and wrote to his fairy godmother,
asking her advice. He sent a weasel
with the letter, and by return of weasel he got
his own letter back again, marked “Gone
away. Left no address.”</p>

<p>It was now, when the kingdom was plunged
into gloom, that a neighbouring King took it
into his head to send an invading army against
the island where Melisande lived. They came
in ships and they landed in great numbers,
and Melisande looking down from her height
saw alien soldiers marching on the sacred soil
of her country.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind so much now,” said she, “if
I can really be of some use this size.”</p>

<p>And she picked up the army of the enemy
in handfuls and double-handfuls, and put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a><br /><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a><br /><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
back into their ships, and gave a little flip to
each transport ship with her finger and thumb,
which sent the ships off so fast that they never
stopped till they reached their own country,
and when they arrived there the whole army
to a man said it would rather be courtmartialled
a hundred times over than go near
the place again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/p095.jpg" width="340" height="572" alt="Princess sitting outside the castle walls" />
<div class="caption">THE PRINCESS GREW SO BIG THAT SHE HAD TO GO AND
SIT ON THE COMMON.</div>
</div>

<p>Meantime Melisande, sitting on the highest
hill on the island, felt the land trembling and
shivering under her giant feet.</p>

<p>“I do believe I’m getting too heavy,” she
said, and jumped off the island into the sea,
which was just up to her ankles. Just then
a great fleet of warships and gunboats and
torpedo boats came in sight, on their way to
attack the island.</p>

<p>Melisande could easily have sunk them all
with one kick, but she did not like to do this
because it might have drowned the sailors,
and besides, it might have swamped the
island.</p>

<p>So she simply stooped and picked the island
as you would pick a mushroom—for, of course,
all islands are supported by a stalk underneath—and
carried it away to another part of the
world. So that when the warships got to
where the island was marked on the map they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
found nothing but sea, and a very rough sea
it was, because the Princess had churned it all
up with her ankles as she walked away through
it with the island.</p>

<p>When Melisande reached a suitable place,
very sunny and warm, and with no sharks in
the water, she set down the island; and the
people made it fast with anchors, and then
every one went to bed, thanking the kind fate
which had sent them so great a Princess to
help them in their need, and calling her the
saviour of her country and the bulwark of the
nation.</p>

<p>But it is poor work being the nation’s
bulwark and your country’s saviour when you
are miles high, and have no one to talk to,
and when all you want is to be your humble
right size again and to marry your sweetheart.
And when it was dark the Princess came close
to the island, and looked down, from far up,
at her palace and her tower and cried, and
cried, and cried. It does not matter how much
you cry into the sea, it hardly makes any
difference, however large you may be. Then
when everything was quite dark the Princess
looked up at the stars.</p>

<p>“I wonder how soon I shall be big enough
to knock my head against them,” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>And as she stood star-gazing she heard a
whisper right in her ear. A very little whisper,
but quite plain.</p>

<p>“Cut off your hair!” it said.</p>

<p>Now, everything the Princess was wearing
had grown big along with her, so that now
there dangled from her golden girdle a pair of
scissors as big as the Malay Peninsula, together
with a pin-cushion the size of the Isle of Wight,
and a yard measure that would have gone
round Australia.</p>

<p>And when she heard the little, little voice,
she knew it, small as it was, for the dear voice
of Prince Florizel, and she whipped out the
scissors from her gold case and snip, snip,
snipped all her hair off, and it fell into the sea.
The coral insects got hold of it at once and set
to work on it, and now they have made it into
the biggest coral reef in the world; but that
has nothing to do with the story.</p>

<p>Then the voice said, “Get close to the
island,” and the Princess did, but she could
not get very close because she was so large,
and she looked up again at the stars and they
seemed to be much farther off.</p>

<p>Then the voice said, “Be ready to swim,”
and she felt something climb out of her ear
and clamber down her arm. The stars got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
farther and farther away, and next moment
the Princess found herself swimming in the
sea, and Prince Florizel swimming beside her.</p>

<p>“I crept on to your hand when you were
carrying the island,” he explained, when their
feet touched the sand and they walked in
through the shallow water, “and I got into
your ear with an ear-trumpet. You never
noticed me because you were so great then.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Prince,” cried Melisande,
falling into his arms, “you have saved me. I
am my proper size again.”</p>

<p>So they went home and told the King and
Queen. Both were very, very happy, but the
King rubbed his chin with his hand, and
said—</p>

<p>“You’ve certainly had some fun for your
money, young man, but don’t you see that
we’re just where we were before? Why, the
child’s hair is growing already.”</p>

<p>And indeed it was.</p>

<p>Then once more the King sent a letter to
his godmother. He sent it by a flying-fish,
and by return of fish come the answer—</p>

<p>“Just back from my holidays. Sorry for
your troubles. Why not try scales?”</p>

<p>And on this message the whole Court
pondered for weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Prince caused a pair of gold scales
to be made, and hung them up in the palace
gardens under a big oak tree. And one morning
he said to the Princess—</p>

<p>“My darling Melisande, I must really speak
seriously to you. We are getting on in life.
I am nearly twenty: it is time that we
thought of being settled. Will you trust me
entirely and get into one of those gold
scales?”</p>

<p>So he took her down into the garden, and
helped her into the scale, and she curled up
in it in her green and gold gown, like a little
grass mound with buttercups on it.</p>

<p>“And what is going into the other scale?”
asked Melisande.</p>

<p>“Your hair,” said Florizel. “You see,
when your hair is cut off you it grows, and
when you are cut off your hair you grow—oh,
my heart’s delight, I can never forget how
you grew, never! But if, when your hair is
no more than you, and you are no more than
your hair, I snip the scissors between you and
it, then neither you nor your hair can possibly
decide which ought to go on growing.”</p>

<p>“Suppose <i>both</i> did,” said the poor Princess,
humbly.</p>

<p>“Impossible,” said the Prince, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
shudder; “there are limits even to Malevola’s
malevolence. And, besides, Fortuna said
‘Scales.’ Will you try it?”</p>

<p>“I will do whatever you wish,” said the
poor Princess, “but let me kiss my father and
mother once, and Nurse, and you, too, my
dear, in case I grow large again and can kiss
nobody any more.”</p>

<p>So they came one by one and kissed the
Princess.</p>

<p>Then the nurse cut off the Princess’s hair,
and at once it began to grow at a frightful
rate.</p>

<p>The King and Queen and nurse busily
packed it, as it grew, into the other scale, and
gradually the scale went down a little. The
Prince stood waiting between the scales with
his drawn sword, and just before the two were
equal he struck. But during the time his sword
took to flash through the air the Princess’s
hair grew a yard or two, so that at the instant
when he struck the balance was true.</p>

<p>“You are a young man of sound judgment,”
said the King, embracing him, while the
Queen and the nurse ran to help the Princess
out of the gold scale.</p>

<p>The scale full of golden hair bumped down
on to the ground as the Princess stepped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a><br /><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a><br /><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of the other one, and stood there before those
who loved her, laughing and crying with
happiness, because she remained her proper
size, and her hair was not growing any
more.</p>

<div class="caption">THE PRINCESS IN ONE SCALE AND HER HAIR IN THE OTHER.</div>
</div>

<p>She kissed her Prince a hundred times, and
the very next day they were married. Every
one remarked on the beauty of the bride, and
it was noticed that her hair was quite short—only
five feet five and a quarter inches long—just
down to her pretty ankles. Because the
scales had been ten feet ten and a half inches
apart, and the Prince, having a straight eye,
had cut the golden hair exactly in the middle!</p>

<div class="chaptitle"><i>FORTUNATUS REX &amp; CO.</i></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a lady who found herself
in middle life with but a slight income.
Knowing herself to be insufficiently educated
to be able to practise any other trade or
calling, she of course decided, without
hesitation, to enter the profession of teaching.
She opened a very select Boarding School for
Young Ladies. The highest references were
given and required. And in order to keep her
school as select as possible, Miss Fitzroy
Robinson had a brass plate fastened on to
the door, with an inscription in small polite
lettering. (You have, of course, heard of the
“polite letters.” Well, it was with these
that Miss Fitzroy Robinson’s door-plate was
engraved.)</p>

<div class="center">
<small>“SELECT BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE<br />
DAUGHTERS OF RESPECTABLE MONARCHS.”</small><br />
</div>

<p class="unindent">A great many kings who were not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
respectable would have given their royal ears
to be allowed to send their daughters to this
school, but Miss Fitzroy Robinson was very
firm about references, and the consequence
was that all the really high-class kings were
only too pleased to be permitted to pay ten
thousand pounds a year for their daughters’
education. And so Miss Fitzroy Robinson
was able to lay aside a few pounds as a
provision for her old age. And all the money
she saved was invested in land.</p>

<p>Only one monarch refused to send his
daughter to Miss Fitzroy Robinson, on the
ground that so cheap a school could not be a
really select one, and it was found out afterwards
that his references were not at all
satisfactory.</p>

<p>There were only six boarders, and of course
the best masters were engaged to teach the
royal pupils everything which their parents
wished them to learn, and as the girls were
never asked to do lessons except when they
felt quite inclined, they all said it was the
nicest school in the world, and cried at the
very thought of being taken away. Thus it
happened that the six pupils were quite grown
up and were just becoming parlour boarders
when events began to occur. Princess Daisy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the daughter of King Fortunatus, the ruling
sovereign, was the only little girl in the school.</p>

<p>Now it was when she had been at school
about a year, that a ring came at the front
door-bell, and the maid-servant came to the
schoolroom with a visiting card held in the
corner of her apron—for her hands were wet
because it was washing-day.</p>

<p>“A gentleman to see you, Miss,” she said;
and Miss Fitzroy Robinson was quite fluttered
because she thought it might be a respectable
monarch, with a daughter who wanted
teaching.</p>

<p>But when she looked at the card she left
off fluttering, and said, “Dear me!” under
her breath, because she was very genteel. If
she had been vulgar like some of us she would
have said “Bother!” and if she had been
more vulgar than, I hope, any of us are, she
might have said “Drat the man!” The card
was large and shiny and had gold letters on
it. Miss Fitzroy Robinson read:—</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Chevalier Doloro De Lara<br />
Professor of Magic (white)<br />
and the Black Art.<br />
Pupils instructed at their own residences.<br />
No extras.<br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Fitzroy Robinson laid down her book—she
never taught without a book—smoothed
her yellow cap and her grey curls and went
into the front parlour to see her visitor. He
bowed low at sight of her. He was very tall
and hungry-looking, with black eyes, and an
indescribable mouth.</p>

<p>“It is indeed a pleasure,” said he, smiling
so as to show every one of his thirty-two teeth—a
very polite, but very difficult thing to
do—“it is indeed a pleasure to meet once
more my old pupil.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mutual, I am sure,” said
Miss Fitzroy Robinson. If it is sometimes
impossible to be polite and truthful at the
same moment, that is not my fault, nor Miss
Fitzroy Robinson’s.</p>

<p>“I have been travelling about,” said the
Professor, still smiling immeasurably, “increasing
my stock of wisdom. Ah, dear lady—we
live and learn, do we not? And now I
am really a far more competent teacher than
when I had the honour of instructing you.
May I hope for an engagement as Professor
in your Academy?”</p>

<p>“I have not yet been able to arrange for a
regular course of Magic,” said the schoolmistress;
“it is a subject in which parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
especially royal ones, take but too little
interest.”</p>

<p>“It was your favourite study,” said the
professor.</p>

<p>“Yes—but—well, no doubt some day——”</p>

<p>“But I want an engagement <i>now</i>,” said he,
looking hungrier than ever; “a thousand
pounds for thirteen lessons—to <i>you</i>, dear
lady.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite impossible,” said she, and she
spoke firmly, for she knew from history how
dangerous it is for a Magician to be allowed
anywhere near a princess. Some harm
almost always comes of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well!” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“You see my pupils are all princesses,” she
went on, “they don’t require the use of magic,
they can get all they want without it.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s ‘<i>No</i>’?” said he.</p>

<p>“It’s ‘No thank you kindly,’” said she.</p>

<p>Then, before she could stop him, he sprang
past her out at the door, and she heard his
boots on the oilcloth of the passage. She
flew after him just in time to have the schoolroom
door slammed and locked in her face.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” said Miss Fitzroy
Robinson. She hastened to the top of the
house and hurried down the schoolroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
chimney, which had been made with steps,
in case of fire or other emergency. She
stepped out of the grate on to the schoolroom
hearthrug just one second too late. The
seven Princesses were all gone, and the
Professor of Magic stood alone among the
ink-stained desks, smiling the largest smile
Miss Fitzroy Robinson had seen yet.</p>

<p>“Oh, you naughty, bad, wicked man,
you!” said she, shaking the school ruler at
him.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">·····</div>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and the King
of the country called as usual to take his
daughter Daisy out to spend her half holiday.
The servant who opened the door had a coarse
apron on and cinders in her hair, and the
King thought it was sackcloth and ashes, and
said so a little anxiously, but the girl said,
“No, I’ve only been a-doing of the kitchen
range—though, for the matter of that—but
you’d best see missus herself.”</p>

<p>So the King was shown into the best
parlour where the tasteful wax-flowers were,
and the antimacassars and water-colour
drawings executed by the pupils, and the
wool mats which Miss Fitzroy Robinson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
bed-ridden aunt made so beautifully. A
delightful parlour full of the traces of the
refining touch of a woman’s hand.</p>

<p>Miss Fitzroy Robinson came in slowly and
sadly. Her gown was neatly made of sack-cloth—with
an ingenious trimming of small
cinders sewn on gold braid—and some larger-sized
cinders dangled by silken threads from
the edge of her lace cap.</p>

<p>The King saw at once that she was annoyed
about something. “I hope I’m not too
early,” said he.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” she answered, “not at
all. You are always punctual, as stated in
your references. Something has happened.
I will not aggravate your misfortunes by
breaking them to you. Your daughter Daisy,
the pride and treasure of our little circle, has
disappeared. Her six royal companions are
with her. For the present all are safe, but at
the moment I am unable to lay my hand on
any one of the seven.”</p>

<p>The King sat down heavily on part of the
handsome walnut and rep suite (ladies’ and
gentlemen’s easy-chairs, couch and six
occasional chairs) and gasped miserably.
He could not find words. But the schoolmistress
had written down what she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
going to say on a slate and learned it off by
heart, so she was able to go on fluently.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, I am not wholly to blame—hang
me if I am—I mean hang me if you
must; but first allow me to have the honour
of offering to you one or two explanatory
remarks.”</p>

<p>With this she sat down and told him the
whole story of the Professor’s visit, only
stopping exactly where I stopped when I
was telling it to you just now.</p>

<p>The King listened, plucking nervously at
the fringe of a purple and crimson antimacassar.</p>

<p>“I never <i>was</i> satisfied with the Professor’s
methods,” said Miss Fitzroy Robinson sadly;
“and I always had my doubts as to his moral
character, doubts now set at rest for ever.
After concluding my course of instruction
with him some years ago I took a series of
lessons from a far more efficient master, and
thanks to those lessons, which were, I may
mention, extremely costly, I was mercifully
enabled to put a spoke in the wheel of the
unprincipled ruffian——”</p>

<p>“Did you save the Princesses?” cried the
King.</p>

<p>“No; but I can if your Majesty and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
other parents will leave the matter entirely
in my hands.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather a serious matter,” said the
King; “my poor little Daisy——”</p>

<p>“I would ask you,” said the schoolmistress
with dignity, “not to attach too much importance
to this event. Of course it is regrettable,
but unpleasant accidents occur in all
schools, and the consequences of them can
usually be averted by the exercise of tact
and judgment.”</p>

<p>“I ought to hang you, you know,” said
the King doubtfully.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Miss Fitzroy Robinson,
“and if you do you’ll never see your Daisy
again. Your duty as a parent—yes—and
your duty to me—conflicting duties are very
painful things.”</p>

<p>“But can I trust you?”</p>

<p>“I may remind you,” said she, drawing
herself up so that the cinders rattled again,
“that we exchanged satisfactory references at
the commencement of our business relations.”</p>

<p>The King rose. “Well, Miss Fitzroy
Robinson,” he said, “I have been entirely
satisfied with Daisy’s progress since she has
been in your charge, and I feel I cannot do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
better than leave this matter entirely in your
able hands.”</p>

<p>The schoolmistress made him a curtsey,
and he went back to his marble palace a
broken-hearted monarch, with his crown all
on one side and his poor, dear nose red with
weeping.</p>

<p>The select boarding establishment was shut
up.</p>

<p>Time went on and no news came of the lost
Princesses.</p>

<p>The King found but little comfort in the
fact that his other child, Prince Denis, was
still spared to him. Denis was all very well
and a nice little boy in his way, but a boy is
not a girl.</p>

<p>The Queen was much more broken-hearted
than the King, but of course she had the
housekeeping to see to and the making of
the pickles and preserves and the young
Prince’s stockings to knit, so she had not
much time for weeping, and after a year she
said to the King—</p>

<p>“My dear, you ought to do something to
distract your mind. It’s unkinglike to sit
and cry all day. Now, do make an effort;
do something useful, if it’s only opening a
bazaar or laying a foundation stone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am frightened of bazaars,” said the
King; “they are like bees—they buzz and
worry; but foundation stones——” And
after that he began to sit and think sometimes,
without crying, and to make notes on
the backs of old envelopes. So the Queen
felt that she had not spoken quite in vain.</p>

<p>A month later the suggestion of foundation
stones bore fruit.</p>

<p>The King floated a company, and Fortunatus
Rex &amp; Co. became almost at once the largest
speculative builders in the world.</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not know what a speculative
builder is. I’ll tell you what the King and
his Co. did, and then you will know.</p>

<p>They bought all the pretty woods and fields
they could get and cut them up into squares,
and grubbed up the trees and the grass and
put streets there and lamp-posts and ugly
little yellow brick houses, in the hopes that
people would want to live in them. And
curiously enough people did. So the King
and his Co. made quite a lot of money.</p>

<p>It is curious that nearly all the great
fortunes are made by turning beautiful things
into ugly ones. Making beauty out of ugliness
is very ill-paid work.</p>

<p>The ugly little streets crawled further and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
further out of the town, eating up the green
country like greedy yellow caterpillars, but at
the foot of the Clover Hill they had to stop.
For the owner of Clover Hill would not sell
any land at all—for any price that Fortunatus
Rex &amp; Co. could offer. In vain the solicitors
of the Company called on the solicitors of the
owner, wearing their best cloaks and swords
and shields, and took them out to lunch and
gave them nice things to eat and drink.
Clover Hill was not for sale.</p>

<p>At last, however, a little old woman all in
grey called at the Company’s shining brass
and mahogany offices and had a private
interview with the King himself.</p>

<p>“I am the owner of Clover Hill,” said she,
“and you may build on all its acres except
the seven at the top and the fifteen acres that
go round that seven, and you must build me
a high wall round the seven acres and another
round the fifteen—of <i>red</i> brick, mind; none
of your cheap yellow stuff—and you must
make a brand new law that any one who
steals my fruit is to be hanged from the tree
he stole it from. That’s all. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>The King said “Yes,” because since his
trouble he cared for nothing but building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and his royal soul longed to see the green
Clover Hill eaten up by yellow brick caterpillars
with slate tops. He did not at all
like building the two red brick walls, but
he did it.</p>

<p>Now, the old woman wanted the walls and
the acres to be this sort of shape—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/p108.jpg" width="309" height="309" alt="Circle within a circle; inner circle: 7 acres; outer circle 15 acres" />
</div>

<p class='unindent'>But it was such a bother getting the exact
amount of ground into the two circles that all
the surveyors tore out their hair by handfuls,
and at last the King said, “Oh bother! Do
it this way,” and drew a plan on the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
an old Act of Parliament. So they did, and
it was like this—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 130px;">
<img src="images/p109.jpg" width="130" height="131" alt="number blocks" />
</div>

<p>The old lady was very vexed when she
found that there was only one wall between
her orchard and the world, as you see was the
case at the corner where the two 1’s and the
15 meet; but the King said he couldn’t afford
to build it all over again and that she’d got
her two walls as she had said. So she had
to put up with it. Only she insisted on the
King’s getting her a fierce bull-dog to fly at
the throat of any one who should come over
the wall at that weak point where the two 1’s
join on to the 15. So he got her a stout bull-dog
whose name was Martha, and brought it
himself in a jewelled leash.</p>

<p>“Martha will fly at any one who is not of
kingly blood,” said he. “Of course she
wouldn’t dream of biting a royal person;
but, then, on the other hand, royal people
don’t rob orchards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>So the old woman had to be contented.
She tied Martha up in the unprotected corner
of her inner enclosure and then she planted
little baby apple trees and had a house built
and sat down in it and waited.</p>

<p>And the King was almost happy. The
creepy, crawly yellow caterpillars ate up
Clover Hill—all except the little green crown
on the top, where the apple trees were and
the two red brick walls and the little house
and the old woman.</p>

<p>The poor Queen went on seeing to the jam
and the pickles and the blanket washing and
the spring cleaning, and every now and then
she would say to her husband—</p>

<p>“Fortunatus, my love, do you <i>really</i> think
Miss Fitzroy Robinson is trustworthy? Shall
we ever see our Daisy again?”</p>

<p>And the King would rumple his fair hair
with his hands till it stuck out like cheese
straws under his crown, and answer—</p>

<p>“My dear, you must be patient; you know
we had the very highest references.”</p>

<p>Now one day the new yellow brick town the
King had built had a delightful experience. Six
handsome Princes on beautiful white horses
came riding through the dusty little streets.
The housings of their chargers shone with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
silver embroidery and gleaming glowing jewels,
and their gold armour flashed so gloriously
in the sun that all the little children clapped
their hands, and the Princes’ faces were so
young and kind and handsome that all the old
women said: “Bless their pretty hearts!”</p>

<p>Now, of course, you will not need to be
told that these six Princes were looking for
the six grown-up Princesses who had been so
happy at the Select Boarding Establishment.
Their six Royal fathers, who lived many
years’ journey away on the other side of the
world, and had not yet heard that the
Princesses were mislaid, had given Miss
Fitzroy Robinson’s address to these Princes,
and instructed them to marry the six
Princesses without delay, and bring them
home.</p>

<p>But when they got to the Select Boarding
Establishment for the Daughters of Respectable
Monarchs, the house was closed, and a
card was in the window, saying that this
desirable villa residence was to be let on
moderate terms, furnished or otherwise. The
wax fruit under the glass shade still showed
attractively through the dusty panes. The
six Princes looked through the window by
turns. They were charmed with the furniture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and the refining touch of a woman’s hand
drew them like a magnet. They took the
house, but they had their meals at the Palace
by the King’s special invitation.</p>

<p>King Fortunatus told the Princes the
dreadful story of the disappearance of the
entire Select School; and each Prince swore
by his sword-hilt and his honour that he would
find out the particular Princess that he was to
marry, or perish in the attempt. For, of
course, each Prince was to marry one Princess,
mentioned by name in his instructions, and
not one of the others.</p>

<p>The first night that the Princes spent in the
furnished house passed quietly enough, so did
the second and the third and the fourth, fifth
and sixth, but on the seventh night, as the
Princes sat playing spilikins in the schoolroom,
they suddenly heard a voice that was
not any of theirs. It said, “Open up
Africa!”</p>

<p>The Princes looked here, there, and everywhere—but
they could see no one. They
had not been brought up to the exploring
trade, and could not have opened up Africa if
they had wanted to.</p>

<p>“Or cut through the Isthmus of Panama,”
said the voice again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as it happened, none of the six
Princes were engineers. They confessed as
much.</p>

<p>“Cut up China, then!” said the voice,
desperately.</p>

<p>“It’s like the ghost of a Tory newspaper,”
said one of the Princes.</p>

<p>And then suddenly they knew that the voice
came from one of the pair of globes which
hung in frames at the end of the schoolroom.
It was the terrestrial globe.</p>

<p>“I’m inside,” said the voice; “I can’t get
out. Oh, cut the globe—anywhere—and let
me out. But the African route is most
convenient.”</p>

<p>Prince Primus opened up Africa with his
sword, and out tumbled half a Professor of
Magic.</p>

<p>“My other half’s in there,” he said, pointing
to the Celestial globe. “Let my legs out,
do——”</p>

<p>But Prince Secundus said, “Not so fast,”
and Prince Tertius said, “Why were you shut
up?”</p>

<p>“I was shut up for as pretty a bit of parlour-magic
as ever you saw in all your born days,”
said the top half of the Professor of Magic.</p>

<p>“Oh, you were, were you?” said Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Quartus; “well, your legs aren’t coming out
just yet. We want to engage a competent
magician. You’ll do.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not all here,” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“Quite enough of you,” said Prince
Quintus.</p>

<p>“Now look here,” said Prince Sextus; “we
want to find our six Princesses. We can give
a very good guess as to how they were lost;
but we’ll let bygones be bygones. You tell us
how to find them, and after our weddings we’ll
restore your legs to the light of day.”</p>

<p>“This half of me feels so faint,” said the
half Professor of Magic.</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” said all the
Princes, threateningly; “if you don’t tell
us, you shall never have a leg to stand on.”</p>

<p>“Steal apples,” said the half Professor,
hoarsely, and fainted away.</p>

<p>They left him lying on the bare boards
between the inkstained desks, and off they
went to steal apples. But this was not so
easy. Because Fortunatus Rex &amp; Co. had
built, and built, and built, and apples do not
grow freely in those parts of the country
which have been “opened up” by speculative
builders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>So at last they asked the little Prince Denis
where he went for apples when he wanted
them. And Denis said—</p>

<p>“The old woman at the top of Clover Hill
has apples in her seven acres, and in her
fifteen acres, but there’s a fierce bulldog in
the seven acres, and I’ve stolen all the apples
in the fifteen acres myself.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try the seven acres,” said the
Princes.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Denis; “You’ll be
hanged if you’re caught. So, as I put you up
to it, I’m coming too, and if you won’t take
me, I’ll tell. So there!”</p>

<p>For Denis was a most honourable little
Prince, and felt that you must not send others
into danger unless you go yourself, and he
would never have stolen apples if it had not
been quite as dangerous as leading armies.</p>

<p>So the Princes had to agree, and the very
next night Denis let himself down out of his
window by a knotted rope made of all the
stockings his mother had knitted for him, and
the grown-up Princes were waiting under the
window, and off they all went to the orchard
on the top of Clover Hill.</p>

<p>They climbed the wall at the proper corner,
and Martha, the bulldog, who was very wellbred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and knew a Prince when she saw one,
wagged her kinked tail respectfully and wished
them good luck.</p>

<p>The Princes stole over the dewy orchard
grass and looked at tree after tree: there
were no apples on any of them.</p>

<p>Only at last, in the very middle of the
orchard there was a tree with a copper trunk
and brass branches, and leaves of silver. And
on it hung seven beautiful golden apples.</p>

<p>So each Prince took one of the golden
apples, very quietly, and off they went,
anxious to get back to the half-Professor of
Magic, and learn what to do next. No one
had any doubt as to the half-Professor having
told the truth; for when your legs depend on
your speaking the truth you will not willingly
tell a falsehood.</p>

<p>They stole away as quietly as they could,
each with a gold apple in his hand, but as
they went Prince Denis could not resist his
longing to take a bite out of his apple. He
opened his mouth very wide so as to get a
good bite, and the next moment he howled
aloud, for the apple was as hard as stone, and
the poor little boy had broken nearly all his
first teeth.</p>

<p>He flung the apple away in a rage, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
next moment the old woman rushed out of
her house. She screamed. Martha barked.
Prince Denis howled. The whole town was
aroused, and the six Princes were arrested,
and taken under a strong guard to the Tower.
Denis was let off, on the ground of his youth,
and, besides, he had lost most of his teeth,
which is a severe punishment, even for stealing
apples.</p>

<p>The King sat in his Hall of Justice next
morning, and the old woman and the Princes
came before him. When the story had been
told, he said—</p>

<p>“My dear fellows, I hope you’ll excuse me—the
laws of hospitality are strict—but
business is business after all. I should not
like to have any constitutional unpleasantness
over a little thing like this; you must all
be hanged to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>The Princes were extremely vexed, but they
did not make a fuss. They asked to see
Denis, and told him what to do.</p>

<p>So Denis went to the furnished house which
had once been a Select Boarding Establishment
for the Daughters of Respectable
Monarchs. The door was locked, but Denis
knew a way in, because his sister had told
him all about it one holiday. He got up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the roof and walked down the schoolroom
chimney.</p>

<p>There, on the schoolroom floor, lay half
a Professor of Magic, struggling feebly, and
uttering sad, faint squeals.</p>

<p>“What are we to do now?” said Denis.</p>

<p>“Steal apples,” said the half-Professor in
a weak whisper. “Do let my legs out. Slice
up the Great Bear—or the Milky Way would
be a good one for them to come out by.”</p>

<p>But Denis knew better.</p>

<p>“Not till we get the lost Princesses,” said
he, “now, what’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“Steal apples I tell you,” said the half-Professor,
crossly; “seven apples—there—seven
kisses. Cut them down. Oh go along
with you, do. Leave me to die, you heartless
boy. I’ve got pins and needles in my
legs.”</p>

<p>Then off ran Denis to the Seven Acre
Orchard at the top of Clover Hill, and there
were the six Princes hanging to the apple-tree,
and the hangman had gone home to his
dinner, and there was no one else about.
And the Princes were not dead.</p>

<p>Denis climbed up the tree and cut the
Princes down with the penknife of the
gardener’s boy. (You will often find this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
penknife mentioned in your German
exercises; now you know why so much fuss
is made about it.)</p>

<p>The Princes fell to the ground, and when
they recovered their wits Denis told them
what he had done.</p>

<p>“Oh why did you cut us down?” said
the Princes, “we were having such happy
dreams.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Denis, shutting up the penknife
of the gardener’s boy, “of all the ungrateful
chaps!” And he turned his back and
marched off. But they ran quickly after him
and thanked him and told him how they had
been dreaming of walking arm in arm with
the most dear and lovely Princesses in the
world.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Denis, “it’s no use dreaming
about <i>them</i>. You’ve got your own registered
Princesses to find, and the half-Professor says,
‘Steal apples.’”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any more to steal,” said the
Princes—but when they looked, there were
the gold apples back on the tree just as
before.</p>

<p>So once again they each picked one. Denis
chose a different one this time. He thought
it might be softer. The last time he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
chosen the biggest apple—but now he took
the littlest apple of all.</p>

<p>“Seven kisses!” he cried, and began to kiss
the little gold apple.</p>

<p>Each Prince kissed the apple he held, till
the sound of kisses was like the whisper of the
evening wind in leafy trees. And, of course,
at the seventh kiss each Prince found that he
had in his hand not an apple, but the fingers
of a lovely Princess. As for Denis, he had
got his little sister Daisy, and he was so glad
he promised at once to give her his guinea-pigs
and his whole collection of foreign postage
stamps.</p>

<p>“What is your name, dear and lovely
lady?” asked Prince Primus.</p>

<p>“Sexta,” said his Princess. And then it
turned out that every single one of the
Princes had picked the wrong apple, so that
each one had a Princess who was not the
one mentioned in his letter of instructions.
Secundus had plucked the apple that held
Quinta, and Tertius held Quarta, and so on—and
everything was as criss-cross-crooked as
it possibly could be.</p>

<p>And yet nobody wanted to change.</p>

<p>Then the old woman came out of her house
and looked at them and chuckled, and she
said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must be contented with what you
have.”</p>

<p>“We <i>are</i>,” said all twelve of them, “but
what about our parents?”</p>

<p>“They must put up with your choice,” said
the old woman, “it’s the common lot of
parents.”</p>

<p>“I think you ought to sort yourselves out
properly,” said Denis; “I’m the only one
who’s got his right Princess—because I
wasn’t greedy. I took the smallest.”</p>

<p>The tallest Princess showed him a red
mark on her arm, where his little teeth
had been two nights before, and everybody
laughed.</p>

<p>But the old woman said—</p>

<p>“They can’t change, my dear. When a
Prince has picked a gold apple that has a
Princess in it, and has kissed it till she comes
out, no other Princess will ever do for him,
any more than any other Prince will ever do
for her.”</p>

<p>While she was speaking the old woman got
younger and younger and younger, till as she
spoke the last words she was quite young, not
more than fifty-five. And it was Miss Fitzroy
Robinson!</p>

<p>Her pupils stepped forward one by one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
respectful curtsies, and she allowed them to
kiss her on the cheek, just as if it was
breaking-up day.</p>

<p>Then, all together, and very happily, they
went down to the furnished villa that had
once been the Select School, and when the
half-professor had promised on his honour as
a Magician to give up Magic and take to a
respectable trade, they took his legs out of
the starry sphere, and gave them back to him;
and he joined himself together, and went off
full of earnest resolve to live and die an
honest plumber.</p>

<p>“My talents won’t be quite wasted,” said
he; “a little hanky-panky is useful in most
trades.”</p>

<p>When the King asked Miss Fitzroy Robinson
to name her own reward for restoring the
Princesses, she said—</p>

<p>“Make the land green again, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>So Fortunatus Rex &amp; Co. devoted themselves
to pulling down and carting off the
yellow streets they had built. And now the
country there is almost as green and pretty
as it was before Princess Daisy and the six
parlour-boarders were turned into gold apples.</p>

<p>“It was very clever of dear Miss Fitzroy
Robinson to shut up that Professor in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
two globes,” said the Queen; “it shows the
advantage of having lessons from the best
Masters.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the King, “I always say that
you cannot go far wrong if you insist on the
highest references!”</p>

<h2 class="faux"><br />THE SUMS THAT CAME RIGHT</h2>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a><br /><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>




<div class="chaptitle"><i>THE SUMS THAT CAME RIGHT</i></div>


<p class="drop-cap">“IF twenty-seven barrelsful of apples cost
£25 13<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, what would the same
barrels be worth if they had been packed by
a dishonest person, who only put in 7/9ths of
apples in each barrel and the rest sawdust?”</p>

<p>This was the sum.</p>

<p>It does not look very hard, perhaps, to you
who have studied ardently for years at a
Board School, or a High School, or a Preparatory
School for the sons of gentlemen; but to
Edwin it looked as hard as a ship’s biscuit.
But he went for it like a man, and presently
produced an Answer and his Master wrote a
big curly R across the sum. Perhaps you do
not know that a big curly R means Right?
As for the answer to the sum, I will try to get
a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge (who
is a very terrible person), to work it out for you,
and if he can do it I will put the answer at the
end of this story. I cannot work it myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Edwin was glad to see the large curly R.
He saw it so seldom that to meet it was a
real pleasure.</p>

<p>“But what’s the use?” he said. “Everything
else leads to something else, except
lessons. If you put seeds in the garden they
come up flowers, unless they’re rotten seeds
or you forget where you put them. And if
you buy a rabbit—well, there it is, unless it
dies. And if you eat your dinner—well,
you’re not hungry any more for an hour or
two. But lessons!”</p>

<p>He bit his penholder angrily and put his
head into his desk to look for nibs to play
Simpkins minor with. You know the game of
nibs, of course? He held up the lid of the desk
on his head, as I daresay you have often done,
and the inside of the desk was darkish, so
that the sudden light at the very back of the
desk showed quite brightly and unmistakably.</p>

<p>“Those firework fusees, O Crikey!” was
Edwin’s first thought.</p>

<p>But it was no firework fusee. It was like
glow-worms, only a thousand times more
bright and white. For it was the light of
pure reason, and it glowed from the glorious
eyes of the Arithmetic Fairy. You did not
know that there was an Arithmetic Fairy? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
you knew as much as I do, it would be simply
silly for me to try to tell you stories, wouldn’t
it?</p>

<p>Her wonderful eyes gleamed and flashed
straight into the round goggling eyes of the
amazed Edwin.</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” she said.</p>

<p>Edwin said nothing.</p>

<p>“Did no one ever tell you?” the fairy went
on, shaking out her dress, which was woven of
the integral calculus, and trimmed with a
dazzling fringe of logarithms. “Did no one
ever tell you that the things that happen
when you’ve done your sums right, happen
when you’re grown up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what happens then,” Edwin
dared to say, for the flashing eyes were kind
eyes. “I shall be a pirate, or a bushranger,
or something.”</p>

<p>The fairy drew herself up, and her graceful
garland of simple equations trembled as Edwin
breathed heavily.</p>

<p>“A Pirate,” said she, “a nice sort of pirate
who can’t calculate his men’s share of the
plunder to three-seventeenths of a gold link of
the dead captain’s chain! A fine bushranger
who can’t arrange the forty-two bullets from
the revolvers of his seven dauntless followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
so that each of the fifteen enemies gets his
fair share! Go along with you!” said the
Arithmetic Fairy.</p>

<p>But Edwin’s eyes were, as I said, wide open,
goggling.</p>

<p>“I say,” he suddenly remarked, “how
jolly pretty you are.”</p>

<p>The Arithmetic Fairy has but one weakness—a
feminine weakness. She loves a pretty
speech. If blunt, so much the worse; yet
even bluntness....</p>

<p>She looked down and played shyly with the
bunch of miscellaneous examples in vulgar
fractions which adorned her waistband.</p>

<p>“I suppose you can’t be expected to understand,
yet,” she said, and she said it very
gently.</p>

<p>Edwin took courage.</p>

<p>“When I do things I want something to
happen at once. ‘I want a white rabbit and
I want it <i>now</i>.’”</p>

<p>She did not recognise the quotation.</p>

<p>“Get your Master to set you a little simple
multiplication sum in white rabbits,” she
said. “Goodbye, my child. You’ll know
me better in time, and as you know me better
you’ll love me more.”</p>

<p>“I ... you’re lovely now,” said Edwin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fairy laughed, and spread her dazzling
wings glistening with all the glories of the
higher mathematics.</p>

<p>Edwin closed dazzled eyes, and opened
them as the desk lid shut down on his head,
swayed by no uncertain hand. It was the
mathematical master’s hand, in fact.</p>

<p>A new example was set. And, curiously
enough, white rabbits were in it.</p>

<p>“If seven thousand five hundred and sixty-three
white rabbits,” it began. Edwin, his
brain in a whirl, worked it correctly, by a
sort of inspiration, like an ancient prophet
or a calculating machine.</p>

<p>When he returned, with his books in a
strap, to the red villa whose gables meant
home for him, he found an excited crowd
dancing round the white-painted gates.</p>

<p>The whole of the front garden, as well as
most of the back garden, was a seething
mass of white rabbits. Seven thousand five
hundred and sixty-three there were, to be
exact. I alone know this. The joyous Edwin
and his distracted parents were never able to
count them.</p>

<p>“What a lot of hutches we shall want,”
Edwin thought gaily. But when his father
came home from the Stock Exchange, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
he spent his days in considering 7⅝ and 10-3/32—no
doubt under the direct guidance of the
Arithmetic Fairy, he said at once—</p>

<p>“Send for the poulterer.”</p>

<p>This was done. Only one pair of white
rabbits remained the property of Edwin, but
these, by the power of the Arithmetic Fairy,
became ten by Christmas.</p>

<p>The rabbits disposed of, peace spread a
longing wing over the villa, but was not
allowed to settle.</p>

<p>“Oh, please ’m,” the startled cook, cap all
crooked, exclaimed in the hall, “the cellar is
choke-full of apples—most of ’em bad ’m—<i>I</i>
never see no one deliver them, nor yet give
no receipt.”</p>

<p>The cook, for once in a lurid career, spoke
truth. The cellar <i>was</i> full of apples. Nineteen
pounds nineteen and twopence and one-third
of a pennyworth—to be accurate.</p>

<p>Edwin went to bed, feeling now quite sure
that he had <i>not</i> dreamed the Arithmetic Fairy,
and anxiously wondering what to-morrow’s
sums would be about. Not, he trusted, about
snakes, or Sunday School teachers.</p>

<p>The next day’s sum was about oranges.
Edwin did it correctly, and went home a prey
to the most golden apprehensions. Nor were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
these unfounded. The whole of the dining-room
and most of the hall—up to the seventh
step of the neatly carpeted stairs, was golden
with oranges. Edwin’s father said some
severe things about practical jokers, and sent
for the greengrocer. Edwin ate nine 3/7th
oranges, and went to bed yellow, but not
absolutely unhappy.</p>

<p>But now he was quite sure.</p>

<p>On the following day his sum dealt with
elephants, and in such numbers that his
father, on returning from business, yielded
to a very natural annoyance, and gave notice
to his landlord that he should, at Lady Day,
leave a villa where elephants and oranges
occurred to such an extent.</p>

<p>No one suspected Edwin of having anything
to do with these happenings. And indeed, it
was not his fault, so how and why could or
should he have owned up to it?</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you of the events
that occurred when Edwin’s sums were set in
buttered muffins. Of the seventy-five pigs
travelling in a circle at varying rates, I can
only say that part of this circle ran through
Edwin’s mother’s drawing-room. Nor can I
here relate the tale of the three hundred
lightning conductors which were suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
found to be attached to the once happy
villa-home. Edwin’s mother cried all day
when she was not laughing, and people came
from far and near to see the haunted house.
For when it came to four thousand white owls
and a church steeple every one felt that it was
more than a mere accident.</p>

<p>Edwin’s master had a pretty taste in sums,
and about once a term he used to set a sum
about canes. Edwin worked that sum wrong
on purpose, so I suppose it served him right
that the canes should be at home before he
was, just as they would have been if he had
worked the sum properly, and as he had
borrowed his father’s razor that morning to
sharpen a slate-pencil, the fifty-seven canes
were not all thrown away.</p>

<p>But it was the sum about the cistern that
convinced Edwin of the desperate need of
finding the Arithmetic Fairy, and begging
her to take back the present she had made
him. It is not polite to ask this, but Edwin
had to do it. You see in the sum the cistern
had to leak three pints in thirteen minutes and
a quarter, but the cistern at home happened to
have a little leak of its own already, where
Edwin had tried his new drill on it, and the
two leaks together managed so well that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Edwin got home he found water dripping from
all the top bedroom ceilings and the staircase
was a sort of Niagara. It was very exciting—but
when the plumber came he let Edwin’s
father know all about the little drilled hole, and
Edwin got the credit of the leak in the sum,
which was much larger and most unfair. His
father spoke to Edwin about this matter in his
study, and it was then that Edwin saw that he
must put an end to the sums that came true.</p>

<p>So he went up to his bedroom with his
candle and his arithmetic book. Directly he
put the candle on the chest of drawers a big
splash of water from the ceiling fell right on
the flame and it went out. He had to go right
down stairs to get another light. Then he put
the candle on the dressing table—splash—out
it went. Chair. Splash! Out! At last he
got the candle to stay alight on the washhand-stand,
which was, by some curious accident,
the only dry place in the room.</p>

<p>Then he opened his book. Somewhere in
the book he knew there must be something
that would fetch the fairy. He said the
Multiplication Table up to nine times-after
that, as you know, the worst is over. But no
fairy appeared.</p>

<p>Then he read aloud the instructions for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
working the different rules, including the examples
given. There was no result.</p>

<p>Then he called to the Fairy—but she did
not come.</p>

<p>Then he tried counting. Then counting and
calling mixed with other things. Like this:</p>

<p>“Oh, good Fairy! One-two-three-four-five-six-seven;
do come and help me!
Eight-nine-ten-eleven! Beautiful, dear,
kind, lovely fairy! Nine nines are eighty-one!
Dear fairy, do come! Seven million two
hundred thousand six hundred and fifty-nine!
I will always love you if you will come to
me now. Three-sevenths of five-ninths of
five-twelfths of sixteen-fiftieths. You were
so kind the other day. Two and two are
four, and three are seven! Do come now—you’ve
no idea what an awful mess you’ve got
me into. Seven nines are sixty-three—though
I know you meant it kindly. Dear Fairy.
Thirteen from thirty-seven leaves twenty-four.
Do come and see what a hole I’m in—do
come—and the product will give you the
desired result!”</p>

<p>Edwin stopped, out of breath. He looked
round him for the Fairy. But his room, with
the water dripping from the roof and the wet
towels and basins on the floor, was not a fairy-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
place. Edwin saw, with a sigh, that it
was no go.</p>

<p>“I’ll have another go in prep to-morrow,”
he said. This he did.</p>

<p>The Mathematical Master was pleased with
himself that day because he had succeeded in
preventing his best boy from yielding to the
allurements of the Head-master and the
Classical side.</p>

<p>Of course his class knew at once what kind of
temper the Mathematical Master was in—you
know we always know that—and Edwin
ventured to ask that the examples that day
might be about a model steam engine.</p>

<p>“Only <i>one</i>, sir, please,” he was careful to
explain. The Master kindly consented, and
by great good fortune the example did not
deal with a faulty boiler, nor with any other
defect—but concerned itself solely with the
model engine’s speed. So Edwin knew, when
he had worked his sum, exactly what pace the
model engine he would find at home would be
good for. He worked the sum right.</p>

<p>Then he put his head into his desk and
began again.</p>

<p>“Oh, good Fairy, if a sum of £4,700 is to be
divided between A, B, and C,—do, do come
and help me. Three-tenths of a pound is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
six shillings, dear Fairy—eleven—twelve—thirteen—fourteen—oh,
lovely Fairy—” and
so on.</p>

<p>But no Fairy came. And Simpkins minor
whispered—</p>

<p>“What are you chunnering about?” and
stuck a pin into Edwin’s leg. “Can’t you do
the beastly example?”</p>

<p>Then quite suddenly Edwin knew what he
had to do. He made up an example for himself.
This was it.</p>

<p>“If 7,535 fairies were in my desk at school
and I subtracted 710 and added 1,006, and the
rest flew away in 783 equal gangs, how many
would be left over in the desk?”</p>

<p>When he had worked it the answer was
one. Very quickly he opened his desk again,
and there was the Arithmetic Fairy, looking
more lovely than ever in a rich gown of
indices, lined with surds, that fell to her
feet in osculating curves. In her hand, like
a sceptre, shone the starry glory of the
binomial theorem. But her eyes were starrier
still. She smiled, but her first words were
severe.</p>

<p>“You careless boy,” she said. “Why can’t
you learn to be accurate? It’s the merest
chance you got me. You should have stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
your problem more clearly, and you should
have said seven thousand <i>Arithmetic</i> Fairies.
Why suppose you had found one fairy in your
desk, and it had been the Grammar Fairy, or
the Football Fairy—what would you have
done then?”</p>

<p>“<i>Is</i> there a Football Fairy?” Edwin asked.</p>

<p>“Of course. There’s a fairy for everything
you have to learn. There’s a Patience Fairy,
and a Good-temper Fairy, and a Fairy to teach
people to make bread, and another to teach
them to make love. Didn’t you really know
that?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Edwin, “but I say, look
here——”</p>

<p>“I am looking,” she said, fixing her bright
eyes on Edwin’s goggling ones, exactly as at
their first meeting.</p>

<p>“No—I mean—oh—I say—” he said.</p>

<p>“So I hear,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, but—no kid,” said he.</p>

<p>“Of course there isn’t any kid,” said she.</p>

<p>“Dear, kind, pretty Fairy,” Edwin began
again.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said the Fairy.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear all I was saying to you
yesterday, when the water was dripping from
the ceiling all over the room?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“From nineteen several spots. Of course
I did.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” said Edwin.</p>

<p>“You mean that you’re tired of having
things happen when you do your sums correctly?
You prefer the old way!”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>please</i>,” said Edwin, “if you’re sure
you don’t mind? I know you meant it for
kindness, but, oh, it is most beastly, when
you get into the thick of it.” He was
thinking of the elephants, I fancy.</p>

<p>“I only did it to please you,” said the
Fairy pouting. “I’ll make everything as it
was before. Does <i>that</i> please you? And
there’s your third wish. You know we
always give three wishes. It’s customary
in the profession. What would you like?”</p>

<p>Edwin had not attended properly to this
speech, so he had only heard “as it was
before” and then “What would you like?”</p>

<p>So he said, “I should like to see you again
some day.”</p>

<p>The Arithmetic Fairy smiled at him, and
her beauty grew more and more radiant.
She had not expected this. “I made sure
you would ask for a pony or a cricket bat or
a pair of white mice,” she said. “You <i>shall</i>
see me again, Edwin. Goodbye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>And the bright vision faded away in a dim
mist of rosy permutations.</p>

<p>When Edwin got home he heard that a
model engine had been discovered in the
larder, and had been given to his younger
brother. There are some wrongs, some
sorrows, to which even a pen like mine
cannot hope to do justice.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">·····</div>

<p>Edwin is now a quiet-looking grown-up
person in a black frock coat; and his hair
is slowly withdrawing itself from the top of
his learned head. I suppose it feels itself
unworthy to cover so great a brain. The
fairy has been with him, unseen, this many
a year. The other day he saw her.</p>

<p>He had been Senior Wrangler, of course;
that was nothing to Edwin. And he was
Astronomer Royal, but that, after all, he had
a right to expect.</p>

<p>But it was when he took breath from his
researches one day, and suddenly found that
he had invented a bran-new Hypernebular
Hypothesis—that he thought of the Fairy,
and thinking of her, he beheld her. She
was lightly poised above a pile of books based
on Newton’s “Principia,” and topped with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
own latest work, “The Fourth and Further
Dimensions.” He knew her at once, and
now he appreciated, more than ever in his
youth, the radiance of her eyes and of her
wings, for now he understood it.</p>

<p>“Dear, beautiful Fairy,” he said, “how
glad I am to see you again.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been with you all the time,” she said.
“I wish I could do something more for you.
Is there anything you want?”</p>

<p>The great Mathematician who was Edwin
ran his hand over his thin hair.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “no.” And then he remembered
the school and Simpkins minor
and the old desk he used to keep firework
fusees in. “Unless,” he added, “you could
make me young again.”</p>

<p>She dropped a little tear, clear as a solved
problem.</p>

<p>“I can’t do <i>that</i>,” she said. “You can’t
have <i>everything</i>. The only person who could
do that for you is the Love Fairy. If you
had found her instead of me you would have
been always young, but you wouldn’t have
invented the Hypernebular Hypothesis.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall never never find her
now?” said Edwin, and as he spoke he
looked out of the window to the garden,
where a girl was gathering roses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder!” said she. “The Love Fairy
doesn’t live in schooldesks or books on
Fourth Dimensions.”</p>

<p>“I wonder!” said Edwin. “Does the Love
Fairy live in gardens?”</p>

<p>“I wonder!” echoed the Arithmetic Fairy,
a little sadly, and she spread her bright
wings and flew out of the open window and
out of this story.</p>

<p>Edwin went out into the rose garden. And
did he find the Love Fairy?</p>

<p>I wonder!</p>

<div class="dotbreak">·····</div>

<p>PS.—The Fellow of Trinity says the
answer to that sum is nineteen pounds,
nineteen shillings and two pence and one-third
of a penny.</p>

<p>Does the Fellow of Trinity speak the truth?</p>

<p>I wonder!</p>

<div class="chaptitle"><i>THE TOWN IN THE LIBRARY IN<br />
THE TOWN IN THE LIBRARY</i></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ROSAMUND and Fabian were left alone
in the library. You may not believe
this; but I advise you to believe everything
I tell you, because it is true. Truth is
stranger than story-books, and when you
grow up you will hear people say this till
you grow quite sick of listening to them:
you will then want to write the strangest
story that ever was—just to show that <i>some</i>
stories can be stranger than truth.</p>

<p>Mother was obliged to leave the children
alone, because Nurse was ill with measles,
which seems a babyish thing for a grown-up
nurse to have—but it is quite true. If I had
wanted to make up anything I could have
said she was ill of a broken heart or a brain-fever,
which always happens in books. But
I wish to speak the truth even if it sounds
silly. And it <i>was</i> measles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother could not stay with the children,
because it was Christmas Eve, and on that
day a lot of poor old people came up to get
their Christmas presents, tea and snuff, and
flannel petticoats, and warm capes, and boxes
of needles and cottons and things like that.
Generally the children helped to give out the
presents, but this year Mother was afraid
they might be going to have measles themselves,
and measles is a nasty forward illness
with no manners at all. You can catch it
from a person before they know they’ve got
it, and if Rosamund and Fabian had been
going to have it they might have given it
to all the old men and women who came up
to get their Christmas presents. And measles
is a present no old men or women want to
have given them, even at Christmas time, no
matter how old they may be. They would
not mind brain-fever or a broken heart so
much perhaps—because it is more interesting.
But no one can think it interesting to have
measles, at any rate till you come to the part
where they give you jelly and boiled sole.</p>

<p>So the children were left alone. Before
Mother went away she said—</p>

<p>“Look here, dears, you may play with your
bricks, or make pictures with your pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
blocks that kind Uncle Thomas gave you,
but you must not touch the two top-drawers
of the bureau. Now don’t forget. And if
you’re good you shall have tea with me, and
perhaps there will be cake. Now you <i>will</i> be
good, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Fabian and Rosamund promised faithfully
that they would be <i>very</i> good and that they
would not touch the two top-drawers, and
Mother went away to see about the flannel
petticoats and the tea and snuff and tobacco
and things. When the children were left
alone, Fabian said—</p>

<p>“I am going to be very good, I shall
be much more good than Mother expects
me to.”</p>

<p>“We <i>won’t</i> look in the drawers,” said
Rosamund, stroking the shiny top of the
bureau.</p>

<p>“We won’t even <i>think</i> about the insides of
the drawers,” said Fabian. He stroked the
bureau too and his fingers left four long streaks
on it, because he had been eating toffee.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he said presently, “we may
open the two <i>bottom</i> drawers? Mother
couldn’t have made a mistake—could she?”</p>

<p>So they opened the two bottom drawers
just to be sure that Mother hadn’t made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
mistake, and to see whether there was anything
in the bottom drawers that they ought
not to look at.</p>

<p>But the bottom drawer of all had only old
magazines in it. And the next to the bottom
drawer had a lot of papers in it. The children
knew at once by the look of the papers
that they belonged to Father’s great work
about the Domestic Life of the Ancient
Druids, and they knew it was not right—or
even interesting—to try to read other people’s
papers.</p>

<p>So they shut the drawers and looked at each
other, and Fabian said, “I think it would be
right to play with the bricks and the pretty
blocks that Uncle Thomas gave us.”</p>

<p>But Rosamund was younger than Fabian,
and she said, “I am tired of the blocks, and I
am tired of Uncle Thomas. I would rather
look in the drawers.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” said Fabian. And they
stood looking at the bureau.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don’t know what a bureau is—children
learn very little at school nowadays—so
I will tell you that a bureau is a kind of
chest of drawers. Sometimes it has a bookcase
on the top of it, and instead of the two
little top corner drawers like the chests of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
drawers in a bedroom it has a sloping lid, and
when it is quite open you pull out two little
boards underneath—and then it makes a sort
of shelf for people to write letters on. The
shelf lies quite flat, and lets you see little
drawers inside with mother of pearl handles—and
a row of pigeon holes—(which are not
holes pigeons live in, but places for keeping
the letters carrier-pigeons could carry round
their necks if they liked). And there is very
often a tiny cupboard in the middle of the
bureau, with a pattern on the door in different
coloured woods. So now you know.</p>

<p>Fabian stood first on one leg and then on
the other, till Rosamund said—</p>

<p>“Well, you might as well pull up your
stockings.”</p>

<p>So he did. His stockings were always just
like a concertina or a very expensive photographic
camera, but he used to say it was not
his fault, and I suppose he knew best. Then
he said—</p>

<p>“I say, Rom! mother only said we weren’t
to <i>touch</i> the two top-drawers——”</p>

<p>“I <i>should</i> like to be good,” said Rosamund.</p>

<p>“I <i>mean</i> to be good,” said Fabian. “But
if you took the little thin poker that is not
kept for best you could put it through one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the brass handles and I could hold the other
handle with the tongs. And then we could
open the drawer without touching it.”</p>

<p>“So we could! How clever you are, Fabe,”
said Rosamund. And she admired her brother
very much. So they took the poker and the
tongs. The front of the bureau got a little
scratched, but the top drawer came open, and
there they saw two boxes with glass tops and
narrow gold paper going all round; though
you could only see paper shavings through
the glass they knew it was soldiers. Besides
these boxes there was a doll and a donkey
standing on a green grass plot that had
wooden wheels, and a little wicker-work doll’s
cradle, and some brass cannons, and a bag
that looked like marbles, and some flags, and
a mouse that seemed as though it moved with
clockwork; only, of course, they had promised
not to touch the drawer, so they could not
make sure. There was a wooden box, too,
and it was wrong way up and on the bottom
of it was written in pencil, “Vill: and anim:
5/9-1/2.” They looked at each other, and
Fabian said:</p>

<p>“I wish it was to-morrow!”</p>

<p>You have seen that Fabian was quite a
clever boy; and he knew at once that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
were the Christmas presents which Santa
Claus had brought for him and Rosamund.
But Rosamund said, “Oh dear, I wish we
hadn’t!”</p>

<p>However, she consented to open the other
drawer—without touching it, of course, because
she had promised faithfully—and when, with
the poker and tongs, the other drawer came
open, there were large wooden boxes—the
kind that hold raisins and figs—and round
boxes with paper on—smooth on the top and
folded in pleats round the edge; and the
children knew what was inside without looking.
Every one knows what candied fruit
looks like on the outside of the box. There
were square boxes, too—the kind that have
crackers in—with a cracker going off on the
lid, very different in size and brightness from
what it does really, for, as no doubt you know,
a cracker very often comes in two quite calmly,
without any pop at all, and then you only
have the motto and the sweet, which is never
nice. Of course, if there is anything else in
the cracker, such as brooches or rings, you
have to let the little girl who sits next you
at supper have it.</p>

<p>When they had pushed back the drawer
Fabian said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us pull out the writing drawer and
make a castle.”</p>

<p>So they pulled the drawer out and put it on
the floor. Please do not try to do this if your
father has a bureau, because it leads to trouble.
It was only because this one was broken that
they were able to do it.</p>

<p>Then they began to build. They had the
two boxes of bricks—the wooden bricks with
the pillars and the coloured glass windows,
and the rational bricks which are made of
clay like tiles, and their father called them
the All-Wool bricks, which seems silly, only
of course grown-up people always talk sense.
When all the bricks were used up they got
the pretty picture blocks that kind Uncle
Thomas gave them, and they built with
these; but one box of blocks does not go
far. Picture blocks are only good for building,
except just at first. When you have
made the pictures a few times you know
exactly how they go, and then what’s the
good? This is a fault which belongs to
many very expensive toys. These blocks had
six pictures—Windsor Castle with the Royal
Standard hoisted; ducks in a pond, with a
very handsome green and blue drake; Rebecca
at the well; a snowball fight—but none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the boys knew how to chuck a snowball;
the Harvest Home; and the Death of
Nelson.</p>

<p>These did not go far, as I said. There are
six times as few blocks as there are pictures,
because every block has six sides. If you
don’t understand this it shows they don’t
teach arithmetic at your school, or else that
you don’t do your home lessons.</p>

<p>But the best of a library is the books.
Rosamund and Fabian made up with books.
They got Shakespeare in fourteen volumes,
and Rollin’s “Ancient History,” and Gibbon’s
“Decline and Fall,” and “The Beauties of
Literature” in fifty-six fat little volumes, and
they built not only a castle, but a town—and
a big town—that presently towered high above
them on the top of the bureau.</p>

<p>“It’s almost big enough to get into,” said
Fabian, “if we had some steps.” So they
made steps with the “British Essayists,”
the “Spectator,” and the “Rambler,” and
the “Observer,” and the “Tatler”; and
when the steps were done they walked up
them.</p>

<p>You may think that they could not have
walked up these steps and into a town they
had built themselves, but I assure you people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
have often done it, and anyway this is a true
story. They had made a lovely gateway with
two fat volumes of Macaulay and Milton’s
poetical works on top, and as they went
through it they felt all the feelings which
people have to feel when they are tourists
and see really fine architecture. (Architecture
means buildings, but it is a grander word, as
you see.)</p>

<p>Rosamund and Fabian simply walked up
the steps into the town they had built.
Whether they got larger or the town got
smaller, I do not pretend to say. When
they had gone under the great gateway they
found that they were in a street which they
could not remember building. But they were
not disagreeable about it, and they said it was
a very nice street all the same.</p>

<p>There was a large square in the middle of
the town, with seats, and there they sat down,
in the town they had made, and wondered
how they could have been so clever as to
build it. Then they went to the walls of
the town—high, strong walls built of the
Encyclopedia and the Biographical Dictionary—and
far away over the brown plain of the
carpet they saw a great thing like a square
mountain. It was very shiny. And as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
looked at it a great slice of it pushed itself
out, and Fabian saw the brass handles shine,
and he said:</p>

<p>“Why, Rom, that’s the bureau.”</p>

<p>“It’s larger than I want it to be,” said
Rosamund, who was a little frightened. And
indeed it did seem to be an extra size, for it
was higher than the town.</p>

<p>The drawer of the great mountain bureau
opened slowly, and the children could see
something moving inside; then they saw the
glass lid of one of the boxes go slowly up till
it stood on end and looked like one side of
the Crystal Palace, it was so large—and
inside the box they saw something moving.
The shavings and tissue-paper and the cotton-wool
heaved and tossed like a sea when it is
rough and you wish you had not come for a
sail. And then from among the heaving
whiteness came out a blue soldier, and another
and another. They let themselves down from
the drawer with ropes of shavings, and when
they were all out there were fifty of them—foot
soldiers with rifles and fixed bayonets,
as well as a thin captain on a horse and a
sergeant and a drummer.</p>

<p>The drummer beat his drum and the whole
company formed fours and marched straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
for the town. They seemed to be quite full-size
soldiers—indeed, <i>extra</i> large.</p>

<p>The children were very frightened. They
left the walls and ran up and down the streets
of the town trying to find a place to hide.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s our very own house,” cried
Rosamund at last; “we shall be safe there.”
She was surprised as well as pleased to find
their own house inside the town they had
built.</p>

<p>So they ran in, and into the library, and
there was the bureau and the castle they had
built, and it was all small and quite the proper
size. But when they looked out of the window
it was not their own street, but the one they
had built; they could see two volumes of the
“Beauties of Literature” and the head of
Rebecca in the house opposite, and down the
street was the Mausoleum they had built after
the pattern given in the red and yellow book
that goes with the All-Wool bricks. It was
all very confusing.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they stood looking out of the
windows, they heard a shouting, and there
were the blue soldiers coming along the street
by twos, and when the Captain got opposite
their house he called out—</p>

<p>“Fabian! Rosamund! come down!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>And they had to, for they were very much
frightened.</p>

<p>Then the Captain said—</p>

<p>“We have taken this town, and you are
our prisoners. Do not attempt to escape,
or I don’t know what will happen to you.”</p>

<p>The children explained that they had built
the town, so they thought it was theirs; but
the captain said very politely—</p>

<p>“That doesn’t follow at all. It’s our town
now. And I want provisions for my soldiers.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any,” said Fabian, but Rosamund
nudged him, and said, “Won’t the
soldiers be very fierce if they are hungry?”</p>

<p>The Blue Captain heard her, and said—</p>

<p>“You are quite right, little girl. If you
have any food, produce it. It will be a
generous act, and may stop any unpleasantness.
My soldiers <i>are</i> very fierce. Besides,”
he added in a lower tone, speaking behind his
hand, “you need only feed the soldiers in the
usual way.”</p>

<p>When the children heard this their minds
were made up.</p>

<p>“If you do not mind waiting a minute,”
said Fabian, politely, “I will bring down any
little things I can find.”</p>

<p>Then he took his tongs, and Rosamund took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the poker, and they opened the drawer where
the raisins and figs and dried fruits were—for
everything in the library in the town was just
the same as in the library at home—and they
carried them out into the big square where
the Captain had drawn up his blue regiment.
And here the soldiers were fed. I suppose you
know how tin soldiers are fed? But children
learn so little at school nowadays that I daresay
you don’t, so I will tell you. You just
put a bit of the fig or raisin, or whatever it is,
on the soldier’s tin bayonet—or his sword, if
he is a cavalry man—and you let it stay on
till you are tired of playing at giving the
soldiers rations, and then of course <i>you eat it
for him</i>. This was the way in which Fabian
and Rosamund fed the starving blue soldiers.
But when they had done so, the soldiers were
as hungry as ever. Which only shows that
soldiers are an ungrateful lot, and it is idle to
try and make their lives better and brighter.</p>

<p>So then the Blue Captain, who had not had
anything, even on the point of his sword,
said—</p>

<p>“More—more, my gallant men are fainting
for lack of food.”</p>

<p>So there was nothing for it but to bring out
the candied fruits, and to feed the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
with them. So Fabian and Rosamund stuck
bits of candied apricot and fig and pear and
cherry and beetroot on the tops of the soldiers’
bayonets, and when every soldier had a piece
they put a fat candied cherry on the officer’s
sword. Then the children knew the soldiers
would be quiet for a few minutes, and they
ran back into their own house and into the
library to talk to each other about what they
had better do, for they both felt that the blue
soldiers were a very hard-hearted set of men.</p>

<p>“They might shut us up in the dungeons,”
said Rosamund, “and then Mother might lock
us in, when she shut up the lid of the bureau,
and we should starve to death.”</p>

<p>For they could not be sure exactly what
size they were, or which library their Mother
would come back to when she had given away
all the flannel petticoats and things.</p>

<p>The dungeons were the pigeon-holes of the
bureau, and the doors of them were the little
“Beauties of Literature”—very heavy doors
they were too.</p>

<p>You see the curious thing was that the
children had built a town and got into it, and
in it they had found their own house with the
very town they had built—or one exactly like
it—still on the library floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it’s all nonsense,” said Rosamund.
But when they looked out of the window there
was the house with Windsor Castle and the
head of Rebecca just opposite.</p>

<p>“If we could only find Mother,” she said;
but they knew without looking that Mother
was not in the house that they were in
then.</p>

<p>“I wish we had that mouse that looked like
clockwork—and the donkey, and the other box
of soldiers—perhaps they are red ones, and
they would fight the blue and lick them—because
red-coats are English and they always
win,” said Fabian.</p>

<p>And then Rosamund said—</p>

<p>“Oh, Fabe, I believe we could go into <i>this</i>
town, too, if we tried! Let us put all the
things in, and then try!”</p>

<p>So they went to the bureau drawer, and
Rosamund got out the other box of soldiers
and the mouse—it <i>was</i> a clockwork one—and
the donkey with panniers, and put them in the
town, while Fabian ate up a few odd raisins
that had dropped on the floor.</p>

<p>When all the soldiers (they <i>were</i> red) were
arranged on the ramparts of the little town,
Fabian said—</p>

<p>“I am thinking of all the raisins and things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
on the soldiers’ bayonets outside. It seems a
pity not to eat the things for them.”</p>

<p>But Rosamund said—</p>

<p>“No, no; let’s get into this town, and perhaps
we shall be safe from the blue soldiers.
Oh, Fabe, never mind the raisins!”</p>

<p>But Fabian said, “I don’t want you to
come if you’re frightened. I’ll go alone.
Who’s afraid?”</p>

<p>So then of course Rosamund said she would
come with him, so they went out and ate the
things for the soldiers, leaving the Captain’s
cherry for the last. And when that was eaten
they ran as hard as they could back to their
house and into the library, where the town
was on the floor, with the little red soldiers on
the ramparts.</p>

<p>“I’m sure we can get into this town,” cried
Fabian, and sure enough they did, just as
they had done into the first one. Whether
they got smaller or the town got larger I leave
you to decide. And it was exactly the same
sort of town as the other. So now they were
in a town built in a library in a house in a
town built in a library in a house in a
town called London—and the town they were
in now had red soldiers in it and they felt
quite safe, and the Union Jack was stuck up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
over the gateway. It was a stiff little flag
they had found with some others in the
bureau drawer; it was meant to be stuck in
the Christmas pudding, but they had stuck it
between two blocks and put it over the gate
of their town. They walked about this town
and found their own house, just as before, and
went in, and there was the toy town on the
floor; and you will see that they might have
walked into that town also, but they saw that
it was no good, and that they couldn’t get
out that way, but would only get deeper and
deeper into a nest of towns in libraries in
houses in towns in libraries in houses in
towns in ... and so on for always—something
like Chinese puzzle-boxes multiplied
by millions and millions for ever and ever.
And they did not like even to think of this,
because of course they would be getting
further and further from home every time.
And when Fabian explained all this to Rosamund
she said he made her head ache, and
she began to cry.</p>

<p>Then Fabian thumped her on the back and
told her not to be a little silly, for he was a
very kind brother. And he said—</p>

<p>“Come out and let’s see if the soldiers can
tell us what to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>So they went out; but the red soldiers said
they knew nothing but drill, and even the Red
Captain said he really couldn’t advise. Then
they met the clockwork mouse. He was big
like an elephant, and the donkey with panniers
was as big as a mastodon or a megatherium.
(If they teach you anything at school of course
they have taught you all about the megatherium
and the mastodon.)</p>

<p>The Mouse kindly stopped to speak to the
children, and Rosamund burst into tears again
and said she wanted to go home.</p>

<p>The great Mouse looked down at her and
said—</p>

<p>“I am sorry for <i>you</i>, but your brother is
the kind of child that overwinds clockwork
mice the very first day he has them. I prefer
to stay this size.”</p>

<p>Then Fabian said: “On my honour, I
won’t. If we get back home I’ll give you
to Rosamund. That is, supposing I get you
for one of my Christmas presents.”</p>

<p>The donkey with panniers said—</p>

<p>“And you won’t put coals in my panniers
or unglue my feet from my green grass-plot
because I look more natural without wheels?”</p>

<p>“I give you my word,” said Fabian, “I
wouldn’t think of such a thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Mouse, “then I will
tell you. It is a great secret, but there is
only one way to get out of this kind of town.
You—I hardly know how to explain—you—you
just <i>walk out of the gate</i>, you know.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said Rosamund; “I never
thought of that!”</p>

<p>So they all went to the gate of the town and
walked out, and there they were in the library
again. But when they looked out of the
window the All-Wool Mausoleum was still
to be seen, and the terrible blue soldiers.</p>

<p>“What are we to do now?” asked Rosamund;
but the clockwork mouse and the
donkey with panniers were their proper size
again now (or else the children had got bigger.
It is no use asking me which, for I do not
know), and so of course they could not speak.</p>

<p>“We must walk out of this town as we did
out of the other,” said Fabian.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rosamund said; “only this town
if full of blue soldiers and I am afraid of them.
Don’t you think it would do if we <i>ran</i> out?”</p>

<p>So out they ran and down the steps that were
made of the “Spectator” and the “Rambler”
and the “Tatler” and the “Observer.” And
directly they stood on the brown library carpet
they ran to the window and looked out, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
saw—instead of the building with Windsor
Castle and Rebecca’s head in it, and the All-Wool
Mausoleum—they saw their own road
with the trees without any leaves and the man
was just going along lighting the lamps with
the stick that the gas-light pops out of, like
a bird, to roost in the glass cage at the top of
the lamp-post. So they knew that they were
safe at home again.</p>

<p>And as they stood looking out they heard
the library door open, and Mother’s voice
saying—</p>

<p>“What a dreadful muddle! And what
have you done with the raisins and the candied
fruits?” And her voice was very grave indeed.</p>

<p>Now you will see that it was quite impossible
for Fabian and Rosamund to explain
to their mother what they had done with
the raisins and things, and how they had been
in a town in a library in a house in a town
they had built in their own library with the
books and the bricks and the pretty picture
blocks kind Uncle Thomas gave them. Because
they were much younger than I am, and even
I have found it rather hard to explain.</p>

<p>So Rosamund said, “Oh, Mother, my head
does ache so,” and began to cry. And Fabian
said nothing, but he, also, began to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>And Mother said, “I don’t wonder your
head aches, after all those sweet things.” And
she looked as if she would like to cry too.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what Daddy will say,” said
Mother, and then she gave them each a
nasty powder and put them both to bed.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he <i>will</i> say,” said Fabian
just before he went to sleep.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> don’t know,” said Rosamund, and, strange
to say, they don’t know to this hour what
Daddy said. Because next day they both
had measles, and when they got better every
one had forgotten about what had happened
on Christmas Eve. And Fabian and Rosamund
had forgotten just as much as everybody
else. So I should never have heard
of it but for the clockwork mouse. It was
he who told me the story, just as the children
told it to him in the town in the library in
the house in the town they built in their own
library with the books and the bricks and
the pretty picture blocks which were given
to them by kind Uncle Thomas. And if you
do not believe the story it is not my fault:
I believe every word the mouse said, for I
know the good character of that clockwork
mouse, and I know it could not tell an untruth
even if it tried.</p>

<h2 class="faux">THE PLUSH USURPER</h2>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a><br /><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>





<h2><i>THE PLUSH USURPER</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a knock at the King’s study
door. The King looked up from his
plans for the new municipal washhouses and
sighed; for that was the twenty-seventh
knock that had come to his door since
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the King, wearily.</p>

<p>And the Lord Chief Good-doer came in.
He wore a white gown and carried a white
wand. If you had been there you would have
noticed how clean the King’s study looked.
All the books were bound in white vellum,
and the floor was covered with white matting,
and the window curtains were of white silk.
Of course, it would not be right for every one
to have such things, even if we were all kings
because it would make such a lot of work for
the servants. But this king, whose name was
Alban, had an excellent housekeeper. She
did all the cooking and cleaned everything by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
white magic, which is better even than <i>nettoyage-à-sec</i>
(if you know what that is), and
only took the good lady five minutes every
morning.</p>

<p>“I am extremely sorry to disturb your
Majesty,” said the Lord Chief Good-doer,
“but your Majesty’s long-lost brother Negretti
has called in from the Golden Indies, and he
says he can’t stay more than half an hour.”</p>

<p>The King jumped up, knocking over the
white wood table where the White Books
were. (We call them Blue Books in England,
but the insides are just as dull whatever
colour you put outside.)</p>

<p>“My dear brother! I haven’t seen him
since we were boys together,” he cried, and
ran out to meet him, tucking up his royal
white velvet robes to run the quicker down
the cool marble corridors.</p>

<p>At the front door of the Palace was the
King’s brother just getting off his elephant.
He was a brown and yellow brother, withered
and shrivelled like a very old apple, and
dressed in a suite of plush of a bright orange,
sown thick with emeralds. All the white
marble terrace in front of the Palace was
crowded with the retinue of the new arrival.
Slaves of all colours—black, brown, yellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and cream colour, dressed in all sorts of
bright hues, scarlet and blue and purple and
orange, with rubies and sapphires and
amethysts and topazes sewn thickly on them,
so that the eye could hardly bear the glow
and glitter of them as they shone in the
sunlight on the terrace.</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome!” King Alban cried,
and kissed his brother on both cheeks, as is
the fashion in Albanatolia and in many other
civilised lands. Then, still holding him by
both hands, he led him into the Palace. The
jewelled gorgeous retinue followed him in,
and the head parlour-maid shut the front door
and put the chain up, because she knew it to
be more than possible that a few odd rubies
and sapphires and things would drop off the
retinue on to the floor, and she thought any
such little odds and ends might as well go
into her dust-pan, when she swept up after
lunch, as into the pockets of any poor people
who might look in during the afternoon to ask
the King’s advice, as they were fond of doing.
This was the beginning of the trouble that
was wrought by the coming of the King’s
brother. Before this every door stood
unfastened all day long, because every one
was contented, and therefore honest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>King Alban entertained his brother royally
for seven days in the good old fashion, and
then gave him a palace of his own to live in.
The Palace was of white marble, like most of
the buildings in Albanatolia, but the King’s
brother had it painted red all over without a
moment’s delay. And then he began to give
parties and to have processions and to scatter
money among the crowd, and every day the
people loved him more. He was a loud, jolly,
joking sort of man, with a black beard, and he
always wore clothes of plush, a material
hitherto unknown; and he always blazed with
jewels, and he had a circus set up at his own
expense in the field at the back of his Palace;
and he introduced horse-racing and animated
photographs—all highly coloured—and thus
became extraordinarily popular: so much so
that the people presently began to forget all
the good that King Alban had done for them,
and to wish secretly that the kingdom had
happened to have a bright, cheerful king like
Prince Negretti.</p>

<p>For King Alban had worked so hard for his
people’s good that he had not had time to be
amusing. He had never had processions and
circuses, preferring rather small tea-parties
with the Lord Chief Good-doer, the Commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a><br /><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a><br /><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of Public Health, and a few chosen
spirits from the Education Department, and
loving best of all to wander alone, dreaming,
among the blossoming orchards or in the
meadows beyond the river, where the white
jonquils grew, or in the lanes between the
pearly may-bushes, or in the terraced garden
of his Palace, where the white roses hung in
heavy-scented clusters, and the white peacocks
spread their tails upon the marble balustrades.
And wherever he went he thought of the
people’s good, and devised new ways of
making them comfortable. Everything was
beautifully managed. Every one had enough
to wear and enough to eat, and enough to
do, which is very important; but they had not
enough to play at, and this was what made
them ready to lend long and discontented ears
to the whispers of the King’s brother.</p>

</div>

<p>Now Negretti was a Magician, and his was
the black or coloured magic which won’t wash
clothes. He was always messing about with
acids and alkalis, and sulphites and bicarbonates,
and retorts and furnaces, and test-tubes,
and pestles and mortars, and the like;
and whenever he happened to make a nice
colour by mixing two or more of these things
together, he always put it in a bottle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
stuck it up in one of the Palace windows, so
that at night his windows were brighter than
any chemist’s and druggist’s in any street,
and the people said it was as good as fireworks.
The King’s palace windows only sent
out a soft white light like moonlight, and this
was now considered very tame.</p>

<p>It was the Magician’s habit to wander
about the town stirring up discontent as
easily as if it had been one of his chemical
messes; and though he was so well known
among the people he was never recognised,
because he always took care to disguise
himself as a respectable person, and the
disguise was quite impenetrable. (I hope you
know what that is?)</p>

<p>One night he sat disguised at the King’s
Head—the finest of the municipal alehouses—drinking
dog’s-nose out of a pewter-pot, and
the grumbling of the people was music in his
wicked ears.</p>

<p>“Alban is not my sort of king,” said the
blacksmith.</p>

<p>“I’d make a better king out of a penn’orth
of putty any day of the week,” said the
painter.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of a king if you never
see him?” said the landlady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“No processions, no flags, no gilt coaches,
no rubies and diamonds and sapphires, no
royal robes of purple and gold—such as a
loyal country has a right to expect on its
sovereign’s back! Only that old white thing,”
said the barmaid.</p>

<p>“No better than a velvet nightgown,” said
the landlady.</p>

<p>“I like a bit of colour, I do,” said the
painter. “Graining I don’t ask for, for he’s
not had the education to know its beauty; but
a good warm maroon, or a royal blue, now!
But, no; it’s white, white, white, till I’m sick
of it. And us all wearing white by law, and
washing done free, by white magic, at the
Palace, on Mondays from 10 to 4. And no
one to have more than a quart of beer of an
evening! I tell you what it is, my boys,
we’re miserable, degraded slaves; that’s what
we are!”</p>

<p>“If we must have a king,” said the blacksmith,
“why not good old Negretti? He’s
something like a king, he is! Ah! if he only
knew how our free hearts beat with him, he’d
be sitting on the throne to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then Negretti threw off his disguise—the
pewter with the municipal arms on it rolled
on the sanded floor, and spilt what was left of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the dog’s-nose on to the disguise—and the
Magician stood before them, pale but firm, his
dark lantern in his hand. It was a magic
lantern, of course.</p>

<p>“Down-trodden slaves!” he cried, “poor
benighted, oppressed people! Follow me!
Let us dethrone a king who seeks to mask
tyranny with hypocritical public kitchens,
and cloaks his infamous autocracy with free
washing by white magic on a Monday! To
the Palace, to the Palace!”</p>

<p>And they all finished up their beer and
followed him, and half the town beside joined
the throng as it pressed through the streets
towards the Eastern gate, beyond which was
the King’s Palace.</p>

<p>Now while the Magician was drinking his
dog’s-nose, disguised as a respectable person,
the King in his white robes was walking
under the boughs of the white-blossomed
pear-trees, for it was spring, and the moon
was at the full. And presently, coming along
over the dewy grey grass of the orchard, he
saw a figure in white, and when it came
close to him he saw that it was a lady
more fair than the fair stars of that fair
night.</p>

<p>“And who are you?” said the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/p144.jpg" width="600" height="389" alt="Negretto telling people at table to follow him" />
<div class="caption">“POOR BENIGHTED, OPPRESSED PEOPLE, FOLLOW ME!”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a><br /><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>“I am a poor Princess seeking my fortune,”
said she.</p>

<p>“You will rest under my roof to-night,”
said the King, and led her through the long
sweet grass under the blossoming boughs to
the Palace garden. When they came to the
terrace the Princess loosed a lantern from her
girdle, set it on the stone balustrade close by
where one of the white peacocks perched in
fluffy feathery slumber, kindled it, and threw
open the horn door. A flood of light
streamed out, bright as spring sunshine,
and fell full upon her, and then the King
saw that her gown was not white, as it had
seemed in the moonlight, but was the colour
of yellow gold, and her hair was red gold, and
her eyes were of gold and grey mingled.
Then for the first time in all his life the King
thought of himself and of his own happiness,
and he caught her hands and said—</p>

<p>“Nothing will ever again content me, not
even doing good to my people, if I must part
from you. Will you stay and be my Queen?”</p>

<p>The Princess said, “I am seeking my
fortune. Do you think you are it?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, my dear,” said the King,
“whether I am your fortune, but I know well
enough that <i>you</i> are <i>mine!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Princess clapped her hands and
said, “That is the right answer! I have
travelled half round the world to hear it; and
will you love me always?”</p>

<p>“Always, my Queen,” said he, “exactly the
same as you will love me. We are not of the
race that changes heart.”</p>

<p>So then they kissed each other as lovers
should, and wandered along the yew-tree
avenue deep in lovers’ talk, and never even
heard the crowd that the Magician had
brought to the front door. So when the
crowd found that the Palace door was locked
for the night it went home again, but it
came back in the morning with trumpets and
banners and scraps of coloured stuff tied over
its white clothing, and the King went out to
meet it.</p>

<p>When the crowd saw him every one began
to shout: “Down with Alban!” “Down with
the White King!” “Free Beer!” “No
more washing!” and things like that.</p>

<p>Then the King stood forth and said—</p>

<p>“What have I done but seek for your good?
When, till now, have I thought of my own
happiness? Who has stirred you up to these
ill thoughts of me? My people, my own
beloved people, have my ears ever been closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to your complaints? Have you wrongs?
Tell me, and I will right them. Have you
sorrows? Make them known and let me
soothe them. Do you not know that your
King is your servant, and lives but to do you
good?”</p>

<p>And the crowd grumbled and muttered, and
one voice cried—</p>

<p>“We don’t want to be done good to. We
want to enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I did not know,” said the King, gently.
“But now you have spoken I will at once
appoint a Minister of Public Enjoyment,
and——”</p>

<p>The Magician was watching the crowd, and
he saw how the sight of the King’s good face
and the sound of his good voice were working
on their hearts that had once loved him.
Now Negretti sprang forward. “One word,
brother!” he cried, and led the King into the
shadow of a close-clipped yew-tree walk. The
moment they were hidden he caught his
brother’s arm and whispered a wicked spell:
and the first words of it were in Persian, and
the next in Greek, and after that came words
in Arabic and Spanish, and the speech of the
county of Essex, and the last words of all
were “be changed to a stone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>And so strong was the spell that the King
was turned to a stone that very minute—a
great white stone—and fell under the yew
hedge, and lay there.</p>

<p>Then the Magician said “Ha, ha!” and,
after waiting so long as he deemed prudent,
he went back to the people, and said—</p>

<p>“I regret to inform you that your King
has proved quite unreliable as a man of
business. When I urged him to sign a
written agreement to keep you always in a
good humour he refused, and then he
remembered an urgent appointment in Nova
Scotia; and he has gone, and taken most of
the crown treasure with him. But, do not
despair, I will be your King, and I have an
income quite sufficient to keep up a small
establishment of my own. And my golden
argosies are now on the way from the Indies,
bearing all manner of precious things, and
bales of plush are on their way from Yorkshire.
So now I am King.”</p>

<p>The people believed him, for they had never
known a King who spoke anything but the
truth. So they shouted, “Long live the
King!” and the matter was settled. That
very day Negretti had the Palace painted
magenta, and covered all the window-sashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and mantelpieces with gold paint, and stuck
embossed coloured scraps on them.</p>

<p>Then he went out into the garden to get a
good look at his magenta Palace from the
outside, and as he went along the clipped-yew
walk there was the Princess Perihelia weeping
over the white stone.</p>

<p>“What are you crying for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m crying for the White King,” said she.</p>

<p>“And why do you cry <i>here?</i>” said the
Magician.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the poor Princess,
and she looked so beautiful that the Magician
went straight into the Palace and told the
Prime Tailor to sew new rubies all over his
new purple plush suit because he was going
a-courting.</p>

<p>The very next day Negretti put on the
purple plush suit as well as the Royal Crown,
and went to the wing of the Palace which the
White King had set apart for the Princess
Perihelia to live in. Alban’s crown was made
of silver and pearls and moonstones, and the
new King had ordered a new crown, all gold,
and stuck as full of rubies and emeralds and
sapphires as a really good Christmas cake is
of plums. (I do not mean the cake they call
“good, wholesome school cake,” but the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
they have at home when there is a party.)
He took all his many-coloured retinue with
him, and they waited on the terrace while the
Magician knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the Princess.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to marry you,” said the
Magician, coming to the point at once; for
he had arranged to have a procession that
afternoon, and he was a little pressed for time.</p>

<p>But Perihelia said, “No, thank you.”</p>

<p>The Magician could hardly believe his ears.
“But you’ll be Queen of the land,” said he,
“and that’s what you’d have been if you’d
married my brother, and, I suppose, what you
wanted to be.”</p>

<p>“O no, it isn’t,” said she.</p>

<p>“Well, what did you want?” said he.</p>

<p>“I wanted to be the White King’s wife,”
said she.</p>

<p>“It’s the same thing,” he said.</p>

<p>But she said: “No, it isn’t, not a bit.”
And it was in vain that he showed her his
best plush suit and the plush suits of his
retainers; she simply wouldn’t look at them,
nor at the precious stones either; so at last
he went off to his Palace to make more rubies
and precious stones and things like that, and
she went off to cry over the white stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Now a lot of tell-tale-tits had built their
nests above the Palace, and some of them
flew off and told the Magician how Perihelia
was always crying in the yew avenue over
the white stone. So he said to his slaves:
“Get a hand-cart, and carry the thing on
to the middle of the bridge and drop it into
the river.” So they did, and the stone
stuck, end-up, in the mud; and when the
golden argosies of the Magician came up
the river, bearing peacocks and apes and
turquoises, every single galley split on that
stone, and the whole treasure went to the
bottom; all but the peacocks, and they flew
away into the country of a neighbouring King,
who thought every one should be useful and
not ornamental; so he cut off the peacocks
tails, and clipped their wings, and tried to
teach them to lay turkey’s eggs. But it is
very difficult to get a peacock to do anything
useful.</p>

<p>So then the Magician set a lot of people
dredging for the lost treasure; and, among
other things, they fished up some poor dead
apes and the big white stone, and as the stone
seemed to have been rather in the way in the
bed of the river, they carted it away to the
fields behind the town, where the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
jonquils grew, and dumped it down there, and
left it among the long grass.</p>

<p>And the Princess could not come and cry
over it there because she did not know where
it was, and besides she was very busy; for,
after she had refused to marry him, the
Magician said, “Very well, then, you can just
do the free washing;” for the royal housekeeper
had given five minutes’ notice, and left
at the end of it, as soon as the new King had
the Palace painted magenta, and no one else
knew how to do washing by white magic, and
though the people had sneered at it in the
White King’s time they stood out for it now,
and said free washing was what they had
always been accustomed to. Poor Perihelia
did not know the white magic; but she
washed by the Sunlight Magic, and everything
she sent home from the wash was pinky
or pearly or greeny, like the little clouds in a
May dawn. The people were pleased, but not
the Magician.</p>

<p>“I like a colour to <i>be</i> a colour,” he said.
“I hate your half measures.”</p>

<p>He was beginning to remodel the kingdom
to his own fancy. Instead of a Lord Chief
Good-doer he had a Lord Chief Magician, and
instead of the Education Department he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
a Permanent Committee of Black and Coloured
Magic, and he shut up the free washhouses.
“Who wants to wash?” said he, and he
ordered a free distribution of nasty medicine
instead; and altogether he was really
beginning to enjoy himself when another
tell-tale-tit came fluttering in at the window
of his laboratory, and, perching on the top
of a crucible, told him of a Rumour. The
Rumour had been running about the town
like a mad thing, and wherever it ran it
left its tail behind it. Rumour, as you know,
is a beast with many tales; and now everybody
knew that the white stone had moved
in the night and had come rolling up to the
gate of the town.</p>

<p>“Whatever shall we do?” said the Lord
Chief Magician, who was pounding up nasty
things in the mortar ready for the free distribution
of medicine next day.</p>

<p>“Smash it,” said Negretti. “I’ll take
a turn at the medicine while you go and see
the thing done.”</p>

<p>So the Lord Chief Magician called together
the Permanent Committee of Black and
Coloured Magic and sent them to break
the stone. And when they began to hit it
with their hammers and picks seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
sharp splinters of white stone flew off, and
each splinter hit a member of the Committee
in the eye and killed him. There were
exactly seventeen members, as it happened.
So then the Lord Chief Magician shut the
town gates and ran home and hid under the
bed.</p>

<p>And the people of the town were very much
interested in the stone that had rolled by
itself and had killed seventeen members
of the Committee, and they made little
parties and picnics all day long, taking their
children to look at the stone and carrying
sandwiches with them and bottles of beer.</p>

<p>The Magician was very angry.</p>

<p>“Such rubbish I never heard of,” said he
when the tell-tale-tit alighted on the window-sill
and told him of it. “If they want to look
at anything, why can’t they come and look at
<i>me?</i> I’m sure I’m coloured enough!”</p>

<p>That night the stone rose up in the thickest
of the black dark, when no one at all is out of
doors, except the Police—and not always him—and
it smashed through the town gate and
came rolling right up into the Square and lay
there.</p>

<p>The tell-tale-tit awoke the Magician in the
morning by singing the news sharply in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
ear, and he went out to see. There was
a great crowd in the Square, and they all
cried out—</p>

<p>“It is a magic stone. It will bring us luck.
Build it into the royal Palace.”</p>

<p>“I might do worse,” thought Negretti.
“If good Roman cement and a double coat of
magenta paint doesn’t keep it quiet nothing
will.”</p>

<p>So he gave orders, and the stone was carted
to the Palace, and built into the wall over the
great gate; and while they were gone to fetch
the red paint to cover up the stone and the
mortar the Lord Chief Magician came out
from under his bed, and went sneaking up to
the Palace and in at the gate, and the stone
fell on him and smashed him quite flat.</p>

<p>Then Perihelia came running out, and she
washed the mortar off the white stone by
her Sunlight Magic; and when the Magician
come out she said: “Let it lie here to-night,
and to-morrow, if you will let me go, I
will take it away to my own kingdom, so
that it shall never trouble you again.”</p>

<p>Negretti agreed, because he did not know
what else to do, and he was beginning to
despair of the Princess ever marrying him,
because he had now asked her to do so every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
day for a month, and always with more
display of plush and jewels, and she said
“No” more decidedly, and even crossly,
every time. So he began to lose heart.</p>

<p>That night, just when the moon was
waning, and before morning broke, Princess
Perihelia slipped down the Palace stairs
and into the garden to look once more on
the place where the White King had promised
to love her always.</p>

<p>And when she came to that same place
there was the white stone lying under the
shadow of the white rose bushes, and pearly
rose leaves had fallen all over it, and were
falling still, like tears.</p>

<p>Perihelia knelt down beside the stone and
put her arms round it, and said—</p>

<p>“Poor stone, dear stone, what is it that
troubles you so that you cannot rest? If
I only knew, I might help you with my
Sunlight Magic. Why are you so troubled,
and why do I pity you so? Oh, if my White
King were here he would understand and help
you! But I can do nothing!”</p>

<p>With that she began to weep over the
stone, calling on the White King to come
back to her. And all the while she was
talking and weeping the moon was waning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and the light in the East grew pearlier and
prettier minute by minute. And as she wept
and clasped the stone she presently saw in the
glowing light that the stone was changing
in her arms. Like white sands falling in
an hour-glass, the white stone fell away and
fell away until the sun looked through the
white rose bushes and saw Perihelia clasp the
living form of the White King in her loving
arms.</p>

<p>The sun’s was not the only eye which saw
that meeting. The Magician had had a bad
night, and he came out early, curious to
see whether the stone had moved again. His
curiosity was gratified.</p>

<p>When the White King saw his treacherous
brother his tongue was loosed—hitherto kisses
had been speech enough for him—and he spoke
the words which he found in his mouth. And
they were, naturally enough, the last words
that had gone in at his ears, and the words
were first Persian and then Greek, and then
Arabic and Spanish, and the language of
foreigners from Essex; and the words he
wound up with were, “be changed into a
stone.”</p>

<p>But the wicked spell that had turned
King Alban into a stone had grown weaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
by keeping (as even ’20 port did when it
was kept too long), and it had no longer
power to do what it ought to have done. It
could not turn the wicked Magician into a
stone, as I am sure you would wish it to
have done; it was only strong enough to
turn him into a wooden post.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">·····</div>

<p>I do not wish to have to mention such
an unpleasant character as Negretti again,
so I will tell you at once the end of him.
He remained a post for ever and ever, and
later on, when King Alban had begun to
do things for his people’s good again, he
thought it a pity to waste even a post, for
he was ever a careful King. So he had it
made into a pump, and the water from it
was bitter and nasty, like the medicine the
Magician used to give the people; and it
was very good for children, and gave them
a nice bright colour in their cheeks. Take
care you do not grow pale, or you may
have to drink the water out of that pump.
It is now at Harrogate, or Epsom, or Bath,
or somewhere, and you might quite easily
be taken there and made to drink that
unpleasant water. The first persons who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to drink it were the Magician’s retinue. The
King thought it would be good for them, and
they were very grateful; but the next night
they stole the State barge, and went home by
sea to their own country.</p>

<p>Among his other improvements, the King
started municipal omnibuses, which were
white and gold. But the pump being near
the place where the omnibuses changed horses
the conductors used to take the bitter water to
wash the omnibuses with, and gradually they
became scarlet and blue and green and violet,
just as you see them to-day. So now you
know the reason of the colour of omnibuses.
And this is the end of the Magician’s part of
the story.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">·····</div>

<p>When the Magician had been turned into a
post, the King said—</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry;” but the Princess
said—</p>

<p>“Dear, he deserved it. And being a post is
not painful. Let us never think of him again.
I have learned many things since I came here.
I have something to break to you. Do you
think you can bear it?”</p>

<p>“I can bear anything now,” said he, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
her in his arms, and kissing her again, because
she was so very dear.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Perihelia, “I am Princess of
the Sun, and if I marry you, my own dear
King, I shan’t be able to help colouring your
pretty white kingdom a little. Just soft sweet
colours, dear, and not an inch of plush. We’ll
make a law against <i>that</i> the very first thing.
And you shall go on teaching your people to
be good, and I’ll try to teach them to be happy.
Do you think I can?”</p>

<p>The White King smiled. “You’ve taught
<i>me</i>,” he said; “but now, before we do anything
for the people, let’s go and get married, and
we can begin to make the new laws directly
we’ve finished breakfast. We shall just have
time to be married if we go off to church
at once.”</p>

<p>So they went off, and woke up the Archbishop,
and were married, and the Archbishop
came home with them to breakfast, and afterwards

<p>The first law was “There is to be no Plush at

the most beautiful country in the world, all soft
sweet colours and clear pearly white; and the
Queen Perihelia has taught the people how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
be happy, so the King has very little work to
do, for they are good almost without his interfering
at all. It is a lovely country. I hope
you will go there some day. I went there once
but they would not let me stay because I had
a black coat on, and gaiters; and the sight of
these clothes made the people so unhappy
that the Queen asked me as a private and
personal favour to go away, and never to come
back unless I could come dressed in something
like the colours of the clouds at dawn. I have
never been able to manage this, and, anyway,
I don’t suppose I could find the way there now.
But, if you could get the proper dress, perhaps
you could?</p>
